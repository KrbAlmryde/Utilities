The sound files in this directory have been pulled from the MBB server. 
They are identical to those files found save for a couple differences, those
being that 
1) I have renamed the folders such that the speaker is identified as
	Female | Male
		masculine | feminine
This was done to simplify things for the programmer (i.e. ME)

2) I have deleted those folders containing those files that were grammatically
   incorrect. This was due to the fact that I had no need for them, so I ditched
   them in order to save space and make my queries that much easier to compute.
