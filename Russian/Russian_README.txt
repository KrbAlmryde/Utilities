 The words (nouns) come in pairs that take one of two case markings.
 Single marked Feminine:
    -oj | -u
 Double marked Feminine:
    -koj | ku

 Single marked Masculine:
    -ya | -yem

 Double marked Masculine:
    -telya | -telyem

 1.  words that can either be marked with a -oj or -u (single marked feminine case)
 2.  words that can be marked with -koj or -ku (double marked feminine case)
 3.  words that can be marked with -ya or -yem (single marked masculine case)
 4.  words that can be marked with -telya or -telyem (double marked masculine case)

 The test words come from six pairs of each type.  We withheld one word of each pair for testing.
 They hear the other word of the pair twice during familiarizaton, but they never hear the test item of the pair.
 So, if subjects catch on that words that can take one of the masc/fem markers can take the other,
     they ought to like the withheld pair when they hear it.  The incorrect word is the same stem with the wrong suffix.

 So, it the test item is monetaoj, they hear monetau 2x during familiarization along with the 146
  other exemplars of the 8 types of case marked nouns.

 Here is the set of test items:
