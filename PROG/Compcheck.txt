# This script massages text generated from a DirectRT .csv file
#
#The first line establishes a while loop which reads from the file ls.txt, and executes for every item in the list.
#The second line removes all but the columns of interest, the first line of the file, and any items not in block 3 or 4
#The third line uses sed to change all ::spaces:: to "_", all "," to "::space::", True to 1, False to 0, changes the
#delimiter to a tab, and finally sorts the contents
#The fourth line calculates the accuracy for each subject, then prints the "subject# = AVG" in a seperate file named Summary
#The fifth line removes the temporary file subject#_A.txt
#The final line closes the loop, and provides the input for the program to run.
