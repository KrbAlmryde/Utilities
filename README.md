Utilities
=========

This project contains various scripts and source code for projects related to the lab and work.
Version Control should give me more flexibility to mess around with projects without seriously
affecting them.

Directory layout
================

* BLK/    * Contains Pipeline Scripts
* CALL/   * Home for the main driver script for the 'call' system
