Utilities
=========

This project contains various scripts and source code for projects related to the lab and work.
Version Control should give me more flexibility to mess around with projects without seriously
affecting them.

================

* WorkShop/             *  Work-in-Progress scripts and makeshift testing ground
* NBack/                *  Scripts for constructing an game/experiment examining 4yr olds attention
* Russian/              *  fMRI experiment examining language features. Scripts designed to process and analys
                        *     data collected. Currently on-going.
* WordBoundary/         *  fMRI experiment examining language features. Scripts designed to process and analys
                        *     data collected. Currently on-going.
* Iceword/              *  fMRI experiment examining language features. Scripts designed to process and analys
                        *     data collected. Currently on-going.
* AttnMem/              *  __COMPLETE__
                        *     Scripts for a publish project investigating attention and memory
* Stroop/               *  __COMPLETE__
                        *     Scripts for a published project investigating the "Stroop Effect" in the auditor domain
* etc/                  *  A place to put uncategorized projects
* SustainedAttention/   *  __COMPLETE__
                        *     A project similar to the NBack, investigating Sustained Attention in 4yr olds.
                        *     Scripts for constructing the game and experiment.
* Call/                 *  __DEPRECIATED__
                        *     Old command line project that attempted to speed up day to day analysis.
                        *     but ended up wasting more time than it saved. This got me into programming
                        *     however, and some of the scripts are still useful
* Dichotic/             *  __DEPRECIATED__
                        *     Pilot study that never took off.
* Drivr/                *  __DEPRECIATED__
                        *     A project similar to Call, but encountered many of the same problems as before
* Rat/                  *  __DEPRECIATED__
                        *     A pilot project involving the analysis of rat brains
* Tap/                  *  __DEPRECIATED__
                        *     A project investigating Transfer-appropriate processing, rejected
