Hi,

I showed you both rcs, and promised to provide more detail.	Here it is.

Here are the notes I referred to but had largely forgotten.
Note, for the Admin commands, there really are dashes without spaces there...weird but true.

We have all inherited these two aliases from my husband:
alias rd				'rcsdiff \!* |& less'
alias rl				'rlog \!* |& less'
They are in your .cshrc, but they won't work on other people's machines.

In the examples below, I bold the parts you actually type.
>> is the weird prompt rcs gives you when it wants you to enter a description of the file.

You can actually go and look at the file in the RCS directory (thanks for trying this Lesley)...and it is just a text file you can display....
It has your checkin messages version numbers etc.

rcsdiff (alias rd) is a little weird to use as it shows you for each line in the file whether it is in the new version or old version using < and >.

There are some tools built into Textwrangler for doing a "diff" operation on a text file (Search->Find Differences)...
same idea as rcsdiff, but you need two complete independent files to do it.

RCS
RCS only works on a single directory at a time (and not subdirectories)
As a rule: diff old new
mkdir RCS

>ci -l .cshrc
>>add a log message,
>>as many lines as you want.
>>When finished, create a new line with a single . on it.
>>.

>ci -l f* (check in all files starting with f)
ctrl d or single . to finish an entry.

>rcs -kb -i wmh3 (checkin a binary file so it is recorded as binary and won't get broken)
rcsdiff (rd alias)
rlog (rl alias)

>rcsdiff .cshrc (shows the difference between the current one and the one last checked in.)
< to create the current file, throw this out
> and put this in

>rcsdiff -r1.1 .cshrc	(different possible comparisons)
>rcsdiff -r1.1 -r1.2
>rd * (useful for seeing what things in the directory are actually in RCS)
>rlog .cshrc (shows your log messages)
>co -l .cshrc (checks out the most recent version to replace the current one.
> rcs -l .cshrc (will lock a file that is inexplicably unlocked)

Admin
>rcs -t-'blah blah' .cshrc change description
>rcs -m1.1:'blah blah' .cshrc change log entry for version 1
