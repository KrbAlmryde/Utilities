This is 3 classes, so most of this will be covered in a blur.
(note that we are not introducing Unix (afni00_unix))

afni01_intro: (skipping physics and most of afni)
    - 1-5   fast
    - 17-21 fast (21: note quadratic baseline)
    - 27-33 slow, fast
    - 36-42 slow, fast
    - 48-51 design
    - 53,54

realtime demos (no to3d):
    - run Dimon command from AFNI_data3/demo.realtime.run1
	Dimon -infile_prefix EPI_run1/8HRBRAIN -GERT_Reco -quit
    - run demo.B.* : advanced realtime results

    #--- skip this ---#
    cd bad.dicom
    ls          # order of files is not proper slice order
                # so "to3d -time:tz 5 34 2.5 alt+z *.dcm"
                # does not work properly
    # will need to terminate this with ctrl-c
    Dimon -infile_prefix image -GERT_Reco -quit
    Dimon -infile_prefix image -GERT_Reco -quit -dicom_org

afni04_interactive (from AFNIintergoals.txt):

    Tasks:
    A. locate data, peruse main afni GUI
      1. go to AFNI_data3/afni and verify there are datasets
            --> cd ~/AFNI_data3/afni ; ls ; afni &
      2. quickly peruse the main window
            - coords, Ulay Image/Graph buttons, BHelp, -> panel toggle buttons

    B. examine anat+orig as underlay
      1. set anat+orig as Underlay, open windows, open/close graph
      2. note xhairs, cardinal views, contrast/brightness controls
      3. compare against Min-to-Max display (in Disp window)
      4. zoom, pan, crop
      5. other menus: right-click in image and in color bar

    C. review alignment between anat+orig and epi_r1_orig
      1. set epi_r1+orig as Overlay
      2. look at edges, CSF (jump-to-xyz: -2 10 2)
      3. turn off/on overlay (toggle button and get 'o' from F1 help)
      4. threshold overlay

    D. review time series, look for motion or other problems
      1. set epi_r1+orig as Underlay, turn off overlay
      2. note graph information, graph size and relation to Image window
            - note Opt->Scale/Matrix and keyboard shortcuts
      3. jump-to-ijk: 22 43 12 (via right-click in image)
      4. ignore 3 TRs (FIM -> Ignore)
      5. evaluate motion : 'v'ideo mode (space to stop), arrows
      6. pick ideal: (FIM -> Pick Ideal -> epi_r1_ideal.1D)

    E. overlay statistics: evaluate full-F and maybe fpos stimulus
      1. set func_slim+orig as overlay, Full_Fstat as both OLay, Thr
      2. set threshold to 7.0, evaluate colored/uncolored voxels
            - note Thr range and individual voxel values
      3. evaluate colors of voxels, Inten range, OLay range, scalar, Pos button
            - note color at individual voxels
            - alter one panel range and color
      4. set thresh -> 12.0, simple Clusterize, look at report (Rtp)
      5. (optional) 4x3x2 coronal montage around peak F, save .jpg image
      6. change OLay, Thr sub-bricks to 1,2 (fpos Coef and Tstat)
            - set p=0.001, note q
            - set color range to 2, 7 Positive colors
            - change one color panel range and color
      7. (optional) 3 hidden menus, consider other color bars

    ------------- optional, continued ------------------------------------

    F. (optional) histogram plugin: 
      1. anat+orig, note background, CSF, gray and white peaks
            - plot, range 300-2000, 100 bins
      
    G. (optional) dataset information: how was func_slim created?
      1. Define Databmode -> Misc -> OLay info
      2. note orientation, extents, HISTORY and sub-brick contents

    H. (optional) standard space:
      1. where is the peak F-stat?
            - Underlay -> anat, and switch to "Talairach View"
            - Image window -> right click -> Where Am I?
      2. Atlas Colors: hippocampus -> blue, amygdala -> red
