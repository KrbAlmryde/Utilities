Usage: 3dNwarpApply [options] sourcedataset

Program to apply a nonlinear warp saved from 3dAllineate -nwarp_save
to a dataset, to produce a warped version of the source dataset.

OPTIONS:
--------
 -nwarp  www  = 'www' is the name of the 3D warp dataset
 -wfac   fff  = Scale the warp by factor 'fff' [default=1.0]
 -source sss  = 'sss' is the name of the source dataset
                ++ That is, the dataset to be warped
 -master mmm  = 'mmm  is the name of the master dataset
                ++ Defines the output grid.
                ++ If '-master' is not used, then output
                   grid is the same as the source dataset grid.
 -newgrid dd  = 'dd' is the new grid spacing (in mm)
                ++ This lets you resize the grid without
                   needing to use '-master'.
 -interp iii  = 'iii' is the interpolation mode
                ++ Default interpolation mode is 'wsinc5' (slowest, bestest)
                ++ Available modes are the same as in 3dAllineate:
                     NN  linear  cubic  quintic  wsinc5
                ++ The same interpolation mode is used for the warp
                   itself (if needed) and then for the data being warped.
 -prefix ppp  = 'ppp' is the name of the new output dataset
 -quiet       = Don't be verbose :-(
 -verb        = Be extra verbose :-)

NOTES:
------
* At present, this program doesn't work with 2D warps, only with 3D.
* At present, the output is always in float format, no matter what
   absurd data type is in the input.
* Program 3dNwarpCalc could be used to operate on 3D warps:
  ++ Catenate them; invert them; pre- or post-apply an affine warp.
  ++ Alas!  3dNwarpCalc has yet to be written.  If AFNI survives the
     coming budget cuts, then it will be forthcoming later in 2011.
