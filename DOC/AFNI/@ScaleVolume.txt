Usage: @ScaleVolume <-input DSET> <-prefix PREFIX>
                     [-perc_clip P0 P1] [-val_clip V0 V1]
                     [-scale_by_mean] [-scale_by_median]
                     [-norm] 
Method 1: (default)
Scale a volume so that its values range between V0 and V1
-val_clip V0 V1: Min and Max of output dset
                 Default V0 = 0 and V1 = 255
-perc_clip P0 P1: Set lowest P0 percentile to Min 
                  and highest P1 percentile to Max
                  Default P0 = 2 and P1 = 98

At the moment, Method 1 only operates on volumes with one sub-brick

Method 2:
-scale_by_mean: Divide each sub-brick by mean of non-zero voxels
-scale_by_median: Divide each sub-brick by median of non-zero voxels

Method 3:
-norm: For each time series T, Tnorm= (T-mean(T))/stdev(T)
