@DTI_studio_reposition <DTI_Studio_volume> <AFNI_reference_volume>
This script reslices and repositions a DTI Studio Analyze format
volume to match an AFNI volume used as input data for DTI Studio.
Check realignment with AFNI to be sure all went well.

Example:
Fibers.hdr is an Analyze volume from DTI Studio that contains
   fiber tract volume data. The Analyze format data will have two files -
   Fibers.hdr with the header data and Fibers.img with the data
   DTI Studio allows saving the fibers as volumes in the Fiber panel,
   disk icon in the lower right
FA+orig is an AFNI volume to which to match the Analyze volume
To create an AFNI brick version of Fibers that is in alignment
 with FA+orig (output is Fibers+orig):

@DTI_studio_reposition Fibers.hdr FA+orig
