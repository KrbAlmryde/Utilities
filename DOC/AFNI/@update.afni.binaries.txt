@update.afni.binaries   - upgrade AFNI binaries

Update the AFNI binaries, either via '-defaults' or by the
'-bindir' and/or '-package' options.

examples:

    @update.afni.binaries -defaults
    @update.afni.binaries -package linux_xorg7
    @update.afni.binaries -package linux_xorg7 -bindir ~/abin

options:

    -help                 : show this help

    -bindir ABIN          : set AFNI binary directory to ABIN
    -curl                 : default to curl instead of wget
    -defaults             : install current package into abin

        This would be the method to 'update the package that I
        am currently using'.

        The package would be decided by 'afni -ver' and the
        directory would come from 'which afni'.  If either of
        these is not appropriate, please specify them as below.

    -package PACKAGE      : install distribution package PACKAGE
    -testing              : just attempt the download and quit

Note that the user must have write permissions in the ABIN
directory.
