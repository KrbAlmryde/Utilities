Usage: fdrval [options] dset sub val [val ...]

Reads FDR curve data from the header of dset for sub-brick
#sub and computes the q-value when the sub-brick statistical
threshold is set to val.

OPTIONS
-------
 -pval   = also output the p-value (on the same line, after q)
 -ponly  = don't output q-values, just p-values
 -qonly  = don't output p-values, just q-values [the default]

NOTES
-----
* Output for each 'val' is written to stdout.
* If the q-value can't be computed, then 1.0 is output.
* Example:
    fdrval Fred_REML+orig 0 `count -scale 0.1 10 20` | 1dplot -stdin
  Uses the 'count' program to input a sequence of values, and then
  pipes into the 1dplot program to make a graph of F vs. q.
