Usage #1: 3dTwotoComplex [options] dataset
Usage #2: 3dTwotoComplex [options] dataset1 dataset2

Converts 2 sub-bricks of input to a complex-valued dataset.
* If you have 1 input dataset, then sub-bricks [0..1] are
    used to form the 2 components of the output.
* If you have 2 input datasets, then the [0] sub-brick of
    each is used to form the components.
* Complex datasets have two 32-bit float components per voxel.

Options:
  -prefix ppp = Write output into dataset with prefix 'ppp'.
                  [default='cmplx']
  -RI         = The 2 inputs are real and imaginary parts.
                  [this is the default]
  -MP         = The 2 inputs are magnitude and phase.
                  [phase is in radians, please!]
  -mask mset  = Only output nonzero values where the mask
                  dataset 'mset' is nonzero.
Notes:
* Input datasets must be byte-, short-, or float-valued.
* You might calculate the component datasets using 3dcalc.
* At present, there is limited support for complex datasets.
    About the only thing you can do is display them in 2D
    slice windows in AFNI.
