Usage: 3danisosmooth [options] dataset
Smooths a dataset using an anisotropic smoothing technique.

The output dataset is preferentially smoothed to preserve edges.

Options :
  -prefix pname = Use 'pname' for output dataset prefix name.
  -iters nnn = compute nnn iterations (default=10)
  -2D = smooth a slice at a time (default)
  -3D = smooth through slices. Can not be combined with 2D option
  -mask dset = use dset as mask to include/exclude voxels
  -automask = automatically compute mask for dataset
    Can not be combined with -mask
  -viewer = show central axial slice image every iteration.
    Starts aiv program internally.
  -nosmooth = do not do intermediate smoothing of gradients
  -sigma1 n.nnn = assign Gaussian smoothing sigma before
    gradient computation for calculation of structure tensor.
    Default = 0.5
  -sigma2 n.nnn = assign Gaussian smoothing sigma after
    gradient matrix computation for calculation of structure tensor.
    Default = 1.0
  -deltat n.nnn = assign pseudotime step. Default = 0.25
  -savetempdata = save temporary datasets each iteration.
    Dataset prefixes are Gradient, Eigens, phi, Dtensor.
    Ematrix, Flux and Gmatrix are also stored for the first sub-brick.
    Each is overwritten each iteration
  -phiding = use Ding method for computing phi (default)
  -phiexp = use exponential method for computing phi
  -noneg = set negative voxels to 0
  -edgefraction n.nnn = adjust the fraction of the anisotropic
    component to be added to the original image. Can vary between
    0 and 1. Default =0.5
  -datum type = Coerce the output data to be stored as the given type
    which may be byte, short or float. [default=float]
  -matchorig - match datum type and clip min and max to match input data
  -help = print this help screen

INPUT DATASET NAMES
-------------------
This program accepts datasets that are modified on input according to the
following schemes:
  'r1+orig[3..5]'                                    {sub-brick selector}
  'r1+orig<100..200>'                                {sub-range selector}
  'r1+orig[3..5]<100..200>'                          {both selectors}
  '3dcalc( -a r1+orig -b r2+orig -expr 0.5*(a+b) )'  {calculation}
For the gruesome details, see the output of 'afni -help'.
