3dresample - reorient and/or resample a dataset

    This program can be used to change the orientation of a
    dataset (via the -orient option), or the dx,dy,dz
    grid spacing (via the -dxyz option), or change them
    both to match that of a master dataset (via the -master
    option).

    Note: if both -master and -dxyz are used, the dxyz values
          will override those from the master dataset.

 ** It is important to note that once a dataset of a certain
    grid is created (i.e. orientation, dxyz, field of view),
    if other datasets are going to be resampled to match that
    first one, then using -master should be used, instead of
    -dxyz.  That will guarantee that all grids match.

    Otherwise, even using both -orient and -dxyz, one may not
    be sure that the fields of view will identical, for example.

 ** Warning: this program is not meant to transform datasets
             between view types (such as '+orig' and '+tlrc').

             For that purpose, please see '3dfractionize -help'
             or 'adwarp -help'.

  usage: 3dresample [options] -prefix OUT_DSET -inset IN_DSET

  examples:

    3dresample -orient asl -rmode NN -prefix asl.dset -inset in+orig
    3dresample -dxyz 1.0 1.0 0.9 -prefix 119.dset -inset in+tlrc
    3dresample -master master+orig -prefix new.dset -inset old+orig

  note:

    Information about a dataset's voxel size and orientation
    can be found in the output of program 3dinfo

------------------------------------------------------------

  options: 

    -help            : show this help information

    -hist            : output the history of program changes

    -debug LEVEL     : print debug info along the way
          e.g.  -debug 1
          default level is 0, max is 2

    -version         : show version information

    -dxyz DX DY DZ   : resample to new dx, dy and dz
          e.g.  -dxyz 1.0 1.0 0.9
          default is to leave unchanged

          Each of DX,DY,DZ must be a positive real number,
          and will be used for a voxel delta in the new
          dataset (according to any new orientation).

    -orient OR_CODE  : reorient to new axis order.
          e.g.  -orient asl
          default is to leave unchanged

          The orientation code is a 3 character string,
          where the characters come from the respective
          sets {A,P}, {I,S}, {L,R}.

          For example OR_CODE = LPI is the standard
          'neuroscience' orientation, where the x-axis is
          Left-to-Right, the y-axis is Posterior-to-Anterior,
          and the z-axis is Inferior-to-Superior.

    -rmode RESAM     : use this resampling method
          e.g.  -rmode Linear
          default is NN (nearest neighbor)

          The resampling method string RESAM should come
          from the set {'NN', 'Li', 'Cu', 'Bk'}.  These
          are for 'Nearest Neighbor', 'Linear', 'Cubic'
          and 'Blocky' interpolation, respectively.

          For details, go to the 'Define Datamode' panel
          of the afni GUI, click BHelp and then the
          'ULay resam mode' menu.

    -master MAST_DSET: align dataset grid to that of MAST_DSET
          e.g.  -master master.dset+orig

          Get dxyz and orient from a master dataset.  The
          resulting grid will match that of the master.  This
          option can be used with -dxyz, but not with -orient.

    -prefix OUT_DSET : required prefix for output dataset
          e.g.  -prefix reori.asl.pickle

    -inset IN_DSET   : required input dataset to reorient
          e.g.  -inset old.dset+orig
