 script to do 2D registration on each slice of a 3D+time
 dataset, and glue the results back together at the end

 This script is structured to operate only on an AFNI
 +orig.HEAD dataset.  The one input on the command line
 is the prefix for the dataset.

 Modified 07 Dec 2010 by RWC to use 3dAllineate instead
 of 3dWarpDrive, with nonlinear slice-wise warping.

 Set prefix of input 3D+time dataset here.
 In this example with 'wilma' as the command line
 argument, the output dataset will be 'wilma_reg+orig'.
 The output registration parameters files will
 be 'wilma_param_ssss.1D', where 'ssss' is the slice number.
