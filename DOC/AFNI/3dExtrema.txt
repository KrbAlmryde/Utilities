This program finds local extrema (minima or maxima) of the input       
dataset values for each sub-brick of the input dataset.  The extrema   
may be determined either for each volume, or for each individual slice.
Only those voxels whose corresponding intensity value is greater than  
the user specified data threshold will be considered.

Command line arguments after the above are taken to be input datasets. 

 Examples: 
  Compute maximum value in amygdala region of Talairach-transformed dataset
    3dExtrema -volume -closure -sep_dist 512 \ 
      -mask_file 'TT_Daemon::amygdala' func_slim+tlrc.'[0]'
  Show minimum voxel values not on edge of mask, where the mask >= 0.95
    3dExtrema -minima -volume -mask_file 'statmask+orig' \ 
      -mask_thr 0.95 func_slim+tlrc.'[0]'


INPUT DATASET NAMES
-------------------
This program accepts datasets that are modified on input according to the
following schemes:
  'r1+orig[3..5]'                                    {sub-brick selector}
  'r1+orig<100..200>'                                {sub-range selector}
  'r1+orig[3..5]<100..200>'                          {both selectors}
  '3dcalc( -a r1+orig -b r2+orig -expr 0.5*(a+b) )'  {calculation}
For the gruesome details, see the output of 'afni -help'.
