        <-tsn TYPE STATE NAME> ...
        [<-spec specfile>] [-h/-help]
  Use this spec file for quick and dirty way of 
  loading a surface into SUMA or the command line programs.

Options:
 Specifying surfaces using -t* options: 
   -tn TYPE NAME: specify surface type and name.
                  See below for help on the parameters.
   -tsn TYPE STATE NAME: specify surface type state and name.
        TYPE: Choose from the following (case sensitive):
           1D: 1D format
           FS: FreeSurfer ascii format
           PLY: ply format
           MNI: MNI obj ascii format
           BYU: byu format
           SF: Caret/SureFit format
           BV: BrainVoyager format
           GII: GIFTI format
        NAME: Name of surface file. 
           For SF and 1D formats, NAME is composed of two names
           the coord file followed by the topo file
        STATE: State of the surface.
           Default is S1, S2.... for each surface.

   -tsnad TYPE STATE NAME ANATFLAG LDP: 
                 specify surface type, state, name, anatomical correctness, 
                 and its Local Domain Parent.
        ANATFLAG: 'Y' if surface is anatomically correct (default).
                  'N' if it is not anatomically correct.
        LDP: Name of Local Domain Parent surface.
             Use SAME (default) if surface is its own LDP.
   -tsnadm TYPE STATE NAME ANATFLAG LDP MARKER: 
                 specify surface type, state, name, anatomical correctness, 
                 Local Domain Parent, and node marker file.
        MARKER: A niml.do Displayable Object (DO) to put at every
                node of the surface. See @DO.examples for information
                about displayable objects
   -spec specfile: Name of spec file output.
                   Default is quick.spec
                   The program will only overwrite 
                   quick.spec (the default) spec file.
   -h or -help: This message here.

  You can use any combinaton of -tn and -tsn options.
  Fields in the spec file that are (or cannot) be specified
  by this program are set to default values.

   This program was written to ward off righteous whiners and is
  not meant to replace the venerable @SUMA_Make_Spec_XX scripts.
