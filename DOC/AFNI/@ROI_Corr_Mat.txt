Script to produce an NxN ROI correlation matrix of N ROIs.

Usage: 
@ROI_Corr_Mat    <-ts TimeSeriesVol>  
                 <-roi ROIVol>  
                 <-prefix output>
                 [<-roisel ROISEL>]
                 [-zval]
                 [-mat FULL, TRI, TRI_ND]
                 [-verb] [-dirty]

Parameters
   -ts TimeSeriesVol: Time series volume
   -roi ROIVol: ROI volume
             This script will resample the ROI volume to match the 
             resolution of the EPI if the number of voxels in each of
             the three directions is not the same. 
             ROIs are resampled using NN interpolation. If you'd
             rather interpolate the epi, then do so before you run 
             this script.
   -prefix output: Use output for a prefix
   -roisel ROISEL: Force processing of ROI label (integers) listed
                   in ROISEL 1D file. The default is to process all
                   ROIs in ROIvol.
                   It is important to use this option when processing
                   data accross subjects with differing ROIVol for 
                   input. If all ROIVol volumes do not have the same
                   set of ROI labels then the correlation matrices 
                   would be of differing sizes.
                   See 3dRank for obtaining a list of ROI labels in 
                   a volume.
          NOTE: ROI labels in ROISEL that do not exist in ROIvol will
                be replaced with empty vectors.

   -zval: Output a zscore version of the correlation matrix.
   -mat OPT: Output matrix in different manners depending on OPT:
              FULL  --> Full matrix 
              TRI   --> Triangular
              TRI_ND--> Triangular, without diagonal (default)

   -dirty: Keep temporary files
   -keep_tmp: Keep temporary files
   -echo: set echo (echo all commands to screen)
   -verb: Verbose flag

Example:
@ROI_Corr_Mat     -ts s620_rest_r1+orig \
                  -roi SUMA/aparc.a2005s+aseg.nii \
                  -prefix s620_matrix_all_ROIs


How to read correlation matrix:
The correlation matrix is created in .1D and .BRIK formats

1. Choose undelay master.2droi.row+orig
      and overlay s620_matrix_my_ROIs_Zval+orig
2. Push Define Datamode Button -> Misc Button -> Voxel Coords
3. Click axial button, and turn + LR Mirror off.
(i, j) on afni GUI means that the selected pixel is 
r- or Z-values presenting correlation between i-th ROI and j-th ROI.
