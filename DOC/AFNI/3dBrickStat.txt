Usage: 3dBrickStat [options] dataset
Compute maximum and/or minimum voxel values of an input dataset

The output is a number to the console.  The input dataset
may use a sub-brick selection list, as in program 3dcalc.

Note: If you don't specify one sub-brick, the parameter you get
----- back is computed from all the sub-bricks in dataset.
Options :
  -quick = get the information from the header only (default)
  -slow = read the whole dataset to find the min and max values
         all other options except min and max imply slow
  -min = print the minimum value in dataset
  -max = print the maximum value in dataset (default)
  -mean = print the mean value in dataset 
  -sum = print the sum of values in the dataset
  -var = print the variance in the dataset 
  -count = print the number of voxels included
  -volume = print the volume of voxels included in microliters
  -positive = include only positive voxel values 
  -negative = include only negative voxel values 
  -zero = include only zero voxel values 
  -non-positive = include only voxel values 0 or negative 
  -non-negative = include only voxel values 0 or greater 
  -non-zero = include only voxel values not equal to 0 
  -nan = include only voxel values that are finite numbers, 
         not NaN, or inf. -nan forces -slow mode.
  -nonan =exclude voxel values that are not numbers
  -mask dset = use dset as mask to include/exclude voxels
  -mrange MIN MAX = Only accept values between MIN and MAX (inclusive)
                    from the mask. Default it to accept all non-zero
                    voxels.
  -mvalue VAL = Only accept values equal to VAL from the mask.
  -automask = automatically compute mask for dataset
    Can not be combined with -mask
  -percentile p0 ps p1 write the percentile values starting
              at p0% and ending at p1% at a step of ps%
              Output is of the form p% value   p% value ...
              Percentile values are output first. 
              Only one sub-brick is accepted as input with this option.
              Write the author if you REALLY need this option
              to work with multiple sub-bricks.
  -median a shortcut for -percentile 50 1 50
  -ver = print author and version info
  -help = print this help screen

INPUT DATASET NAMES
-------------------
This program accepts datasets that are modified on input according to the
following schemes:
  'r1+orig[3..5]'                                    {sub-brick selector}
  'r1+orig<100..200>'                                {sub-range selector}
  'r1+orig[3..5]<100..200>'                          {both selectors}
  '3dcalc( -a r1+orig -b r2+orig -expr 0.5*(a+b) )'  {calculation}
For the gruesome details, see the output of 'afni -help'.
