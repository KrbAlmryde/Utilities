Usage:   from3d [options] -input fname -prefix rname
Purpose: Extract 2D image files from a 3D AFNI dataset.
Options:
-v             Print out verbose information during the run.
-nsize         Adjust size of 2D data file to be NxN, by padding
                 with zeros, where N is a power of 2.
-raw           Write images in 'raw' format (just the data bytes)
                 N.B.: there will be no header information saying
                       what the image dimensions are - you'll have
                       to get that information from the x and y
                       axis information output by 3dinfo.
-float         Write images as floats, no matter what they are in
                 the dataset itself.
-zfirst num    Set 'num' = number of first z slice to be extracted.
                 (default = 1)
-zlast num     Set 'num' = number of last z slice to be extracted.
                 (default = largest)
-tfirst num    Set 'num' = number of first time slice to be extracted.
                 (default = 1)
-tlast num     Set 'num' = number of last time slice to be extracted.
                 (default = largest)
-input fname   Read 3D dataset from file 'fname'.
                 'fname' may include a sub-brick selector list.
-prefix rname  Write 2D images using prefix 'rname'.

               (-input and -prefix are non-optional options: they)
               (must be present or the program will not execute. )

N.B.: * Image data is extracted directly from the dataset bricks.
         If a brick has a floating point scaling factor, it will NOT
         be applied.
      * Images are extracted parallel to the xy-plane of the dataset
         orientation (which can be determined by program 3dinfo).
         This is the order in which the images were input to the
         dataset originally, via to3d.
      * If either of these conditions is unacceptable, you can also
         try to use the Save:bkg function from an AFNI image window.
