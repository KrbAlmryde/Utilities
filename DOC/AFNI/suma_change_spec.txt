suma_change_spec:
 This program changes SUMA's surface specification (Spec) files.
 At minimum, the flags input and state are required.
Available flags:
  input: Which is the SUMA Spec file you want to change.
  state: The state within the Spec file you want to change.
  domainparent: The new Domain Parent for the state within the 
	Spec file you want to change.
  output: The name to which your new Spec file will be temporarily
	written to. (this flag is optional, if omitted the new Spec
	file will be temporarily written to 'input_file.change').
  remove: This flag will remove the automatically created backup.
  anatomical: This will add 'Anatomical = Y' to the selected
	SurfaceState.
Usage:
 This program will take the user given flags and create a spec file,
 named from the output flag or <input>.change.  It will then take
 this new spec file and overwrite the original input file.  If the -remove
 flag is not used the original input file can be found at <inputfile>.bkp.
 If the -remove is used the .bkp file will be  automatically deleted.

 ex. suma_change_spec -input <file> -state <statename> 
	-domainparent <new_parent> -anatomical
