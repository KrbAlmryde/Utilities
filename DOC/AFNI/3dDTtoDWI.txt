Usage: 3dDTtoDWI [options] gradient-file I0-dataset DT-dataset
Computes  multiple gradient images from 6 principle direction tensors and
    corresponding gradient vector coordinates applied to the I0-dataset.
 The program takes three parameters as input :  
    a 1D file of the gradient vectors with lines of ASCII floats Gxi,Gyi,Gzi.
    Only the non-zero gradient vectors are included in this file (no G0 line).
 The I0 dataset is a volume without any gradient applied.
 The DT dataset is the 6-sub-brick dataset containing the diffusion tensor data,
    Dxx, Dxy, Dyy, Dxz, Dyz, Dzz (lower triangular row-wise order)
 Options:
   -prefix pname = Use 'pname' for the output dataset prefix name.
    [default='DWI']
   -automask =  mask dataset so that the gradient images are computed only for
    high-intensity (presumably brain) voxels.  The intensity level is
    determined the same way that 3dClipLevel works.

   -datum type = output dataset type [float/short/byte] (default is float).
   -help = show this help screen.
 Example:
  3dDTtoDWI -prefix DWI -automask tensor25.1D 'DT+orig[26]' DT+orig.

 The output is a n sub-brick bucket dataset containing computed DWI images.
    where n is the number of vectors in the gradient file + 1


INPUT DATASET NAMES
-------------------
This program accepts datasets that are modified on input according to the
following schemes:
  'r1+orig[3..5]'                                    {sub-brick selector}
  'r1+orig<100..200>'                                {sub-range selector}
  'r1+orig[3..5]<100..200>'                          {both selectors}
  '3dcalc( -a r1+orig -b r2+orig -expr 0.5*(a+b) )'  {calculation}
For the gruesome details, see the output of 'afni -help'.
