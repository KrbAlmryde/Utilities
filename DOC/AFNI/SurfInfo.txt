Usage: SurfInfo [options] <surface> 
   surface: A surface specified in any of the methods 
            shown below.
   Optional Params:
     -detail DETAIL: 1 = calculate surface metrics.
     -debug DEBUG: Debugging level (2 turns LocalHead ON)
   Specific Info: Using any of these options outputs values
                  only for the specified parameters.
     -N_Node: Number of nodes
     -N_FaceSet or -N_Tri: Number of triangles.
     
     -quiet: Do not include name of parameter in output.
     -sep SEP: Use string SEP to separate parameter values.
               Default is ' ; '
 Specifying input surfaces using -i or -i_TYPE options: 
    -i_TYPE inSurf specifies the input surface,
            TYPE is one of the following:
       fs: FreeSurfer surface. 
           If surface name has .asc it is assumed to be
           in ASCII format. Otherwise it is assumed to be
           in BINARY_BE (Big Endian) format.
           Patches in Binary format cannot be read at the moment.
       sf: SureFit surface. 
           You must specify the .coord followed by the .topo file.
       vec (or 1D): Simple ascii matrix format. 
            You must specify the coord (NodeList) file followed by 
            the topo (FaceSetList) file.
            coord contains 3 floats per line, representing 
            X Y Z vertex coordinates.
            topo contains 3 ints per line, representing 
            v1 v2 v3 triangle vertices.
       ply: PLY format, ascii or binary.
            Only vertex and triangulation info is preserved.
       mni: MNI .obj format, ascii only.
            Only vertex, triangulation, and node normals info is preserved.
       byu: BYU format, ascii.
            Polygons with more than 3 edges are turned into
            triangles.
       bv: BrainVoyager format. 
           Only vertex and triangulation info is preserved.
       dx: OpenDX ascii mesh format.
           Only vertex and triangulation info is preserved.
           Requires presence of 3 objects, the one of class 
           'field' should contain 2 components 'positions'
           and 'connections' that point to the two objects
           containing node coordinates and topology, respectively.
       gii: GIFTI XML surface format.
 Note that if the surface filename has the proper extension, 
 it is enough to use the -i option and let the programs guess
 the type from the extension.
 Specifying surfaces using -t* options: 
   -tn TYPE NAME: specify surface type and name.
                  See below for help on the parameters.
   -tsn TYPE STATE NAME: specify surface type state and name.
        TYPE: Choose from the following (case sensitive):
           1D: 1D format
           FS: FreeSurfer ascii format
           PLY: ply format
           MNI: MNI obj ascii format
           BYU: byu format
           SF: Caret/SureFit format
           BV: BrainVoyager format
           GII: GIFTI format
        NAME: Name of surface file. 
           For SF and 1D formats, NAME is composed of two names
           the coord file followed by the topo file
        STATE: State of the surface.
           Default is S1, S2.... for each surface.
 Specifying a Surface Volume:
    -sv SurfaceVolume [VolParam for sf surfaces]
       If you supply a surface volume, the coordinates of the input surface.
        are modified to SUMA's convention and aligned with SurfaceVolume.
        You must also specify a VolParam file for SureFit surfaces.
 Specifying a surface specification (spec) file:
    -spec SPEC: specify the name of the SPEC file.
 Specifying a surface using -surf_? method:
    -surf_A SURFACE: specify the name of the first
            surface to load. If the program requires
            or allows multiple surfaces, use -surf_B
            ... -surf_Z .
            You need not use _A if only one surface is
            expected.
            SURFACE is the name of the surface as specified
            in the SPEC file. The use of -surf_ option 
            requires the use of -spec option.
   [-novolreg|-noxform]: Ignore any Rotate, Volreg, Tagalign, 
                or WarpDrive transformations present in 
                the Surface Volume.
  Common Debugging Options:
   [-trace]: Turns on In/Out debug and Memory tracing.
             For speeding up the tracing log, I recommend 
             you redirect stdout to a file when using this option.
             For example, if you were running suma you would use:
             suma -spec lh.spec -sv ... > TraceFile
             This option replaces the old -iodbg and -memdbg.
   [-TRACE]: Turns on extreme tracing.
   [-nomall]: Turn off memory tracing.
   [-yesmall]: Turn on memory tracing (default).
  NOTE: For programs that output results to stdout
    (that is to your shell/screen), the debugging info
    might get mixed up with your results.
