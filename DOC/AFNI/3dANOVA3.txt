                               factor B level j

The following command generates one AFNI 'bucket' type dataset:

[-bucket prefix]         create one AFNI 'bucket' dataset whose
                           sub-bricks are obtained by concatenating
                           the above output files; the output 'bucket'
                           is written to file with prefix file name

Modified ANOVA computation options:    (December, 2005)

     ** These options apply to model types 4 and 5, only.
        For details, see http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/sscc/gangc/ANOVA_Mod.html

[-old_method]       request to perform ANOVA using the previous
                    functionality (requires -OK, also)

[-OK]               confirm you understand that contrasts that
                    do not sum to zero have inflated t-stats, and
                    contrasts that do sum to zero assume sphericity
                    (to be used with -old_method)

[-assume_sph]       assume sphericity (zero-sum contrasts, only)

                    This allows use of the old_method for
                    computing contrasts which sum to zero (this
                    includes diffs, for instance).  Any contrast
                    that does not sum to zero is invalid, and
                    cannot be used with this option (such as
                    ameans).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
example: "classic" houses/faces/donuts for 4 subjects (2 genders)
         (level sets are gender (M/W), image (H/F/D), and subject)

    Note: factor C is really subject within gender (since it is
          nested).  There are 4 subjects in this example, and 2
          subjects per gender.  So clevels is 2.

N.B.: For this program, the user must specify 1 and only 1 sub-brick
      with each -dset command. That is, if an input dataset contains
      more than 1 sub-brick, a sub-brick selector must be used, e.g.:
      -dset 2 4 5 'fred+orig[3]'

INPUT DATASET NAMES
-------------------
This program accepts datasets that are modified on input according to the
following schemes:
  'r1+orig[3..5]'                                    {sub-brick selector}
  'r1+orig<100..200>'                                {sub-range selector}
  'r1+orig[3..5]<100..200>'                          {both selectors}
  '3dcalc( -a r1+orig -b r2+orig -expr 0.5*(a+b) )'  {calculation}
For the gruesome details, see the output of 'afni -help'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STORAGE FORMAT:
---------------
The default output format is to store the results as scaled short
(16-bit) integers.  This truncantion might cause significant errors.
If you receive warnings that look like this:
  *+ WARNING: TvsF[0] scale to shorts misfit = 8.09% -- *** Beware
then you can force the results to be saved in float format by
defining the environment variable AFNI_FLOATIZE to be YES
before running the program.  For convenience, you can do this
on the command line, as in
  3dANOVA -DAFNI_FLOATIZE=YES ... other options ...
