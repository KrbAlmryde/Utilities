Usage: 3dTagalign [options] dset
Rotates/translates dataset 'dset' to be aligned with the master,
using the tagsets embedded in their .HEAD files.

Options:
 -master mset  = Use dataset 'mset' as the master dataset
                   [this is a nonoptional option]

 -nokeeptags   = Don't put transformed locations of dset's tags
                   into the output dataset [default = keep tags]

 -matvec mfile = Write the matrix+vector of the transformation to
                   file 'mfile'.  This can be used as input to the
                   '-matvec_in2out' option of 3dWarp, if you want
                   to align other datasets in the same way (e.g.,
                   functional datasets).

 -rotate       = Compute the best transformation as a rotation + shift.
                   This is the default.

 -affine       = Compute the best transformation as a general affine
                   map rather than just a rotation + shift.  In all
                   cases, the transformation from input to output
                   coordinates is of the form
                      [out] = [R] [in] + [V]
                   where [R] is a 3x3 matrix and [V] is a 3-vector.
                   By default, [R] is computed as a proper (det=1)
                   rotation matrix (3 parameters).  The '-affine'
                   option says to fit [R] as a general matrix
                   (9 parameters).
           N.B.: An affine transformation can rotate, rescale, and
                   shear the volume.  Be sure to look at the dataset
                   before and after to make sure things are OK.

 -rotscl       = Compute transformation as a rotation times an isotropic
                   scaling; that is, [R] is an orthogonal matrix times
                   a scalar.
           N.B.: '-affine' and '-rotscl' do unweighted least squares.

 -prefix pp    = Use 'pp' as the prefix for the output dataset.
                   [default = 'tagalign']
 -verb         = Print progress reports
 -dummy        = Don't actually rotate the dataset, just compute
                   the transformation matrix and vector.  If
                   '-matvec' is used, the mfile will be written.

Nota Bene:
* Cubic interpolation is used.  The transformation is carried out
  using the same methods as program 3dWarp.
