Program to calculate the cross-correlation of an ideal reference waveform  
with the measured FMRI time series for each voxel.                         
                                                                       
Usage:                                                                 
3dfim+                                                                 
-input fname       fname = filename of input 3d+time dataset           
[-input1D dname]   dname = filename of single (fMRI) .1D time series   
[-mask mname]      mname = filename of 3d mask dataset                 
[-nfirst fnum]     fnum = number of first dataset image to use in      
                     the cross-correlation procedure. (default = 0)    
[-nlast  lnum]     lnum = number of last dataset image to use in       
                     the cross-correlation procedure. (default = last) 
[-polort pnum]     pnum = degree of polynomial corresponding to the    
                     baseline model  (pnum = 0, 1, etc.)               
                     (default: pnum = 1). Use -1 for no baseline model.
[-fim_thr p]       p = fim internal mask threshold value (0 <= p <= 1) 
                     (default: p = 0.0999)                             
[-cdisp cval]      Write (to screen) results for those voxels          
                     whose correlation stat. > cval  (0 <= cval <= 1)  
                     (default: disabled)                               
[-ort_file sname]  sname = input ort time series file name             
-ideal_file rname  rname = input ideal time series file name           
                                                                       
            Note:  The -ort_file and -ideal_file commands may be used  
                   more than once.                                     
            Note:  If files sname or rname contain multiple columns,   
                   then ALL columns will be used as ort or ideal       
                   time series.  However, individual columns or        
                   a subset of columns may be selected using a file    
                   name specification like 'fred.1D[0,3,5]', which     
                   indicates that only columns #0, #3, and #5 will     
                   be used for input.                                  

[-out param]       Flag to output the specified parameter, where       
                   the string 'param' may be any one of the following:

    % Change       P-P amplitude of signal response / Baseline        
    Baseline       Average of baseline model response

  % From Ave       P-P amplitude of signal response / Average         
     Average       Baseline + average of signal response              
  % From Top       P-P amplitude of signal response / Topline         
     Topline       Baseline + P-P amplitude of signal response        
 Sigma Resid       Std. Dev. of residuals from best fit               
         All       This specifies all of the above parameters       
 Spearman CC       Spearman correlation coefficient                   
 Quadrant CC       Quadrant correlation coefficient                   
                                                                       
            Note:  Multiple '-out' commands may be used.               
            Note:  If a parameter name contains imbedded spaces, the   
                   entire parameter name must be enclosed by quotes,   
                   e.g.,  -out 'Fit Coef'                                   
                                                                       
[-bucket bprefix]  Create one AFNI 'bucket' dataset containing the     
                   parameters of interest, as specified by the above   
                   '-out' commands.                                    
                   The output 'bucket' dataset is written to a file    
                   with the prefix name bprefix.
