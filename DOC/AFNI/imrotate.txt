Usage: imrotate [-linear | -Fourier] dx dy phi input_image output_image
Shifts and rotates an image:
  dx pixels rightwards (not necessarily an integer)
  dy pixels downwards
  phi degrees clockwise
  -linear means to use bilinear interpolation (default is bicubic)
  -Fourier means to use Fourier interpolaion
Values outside the input_image are taken to be zero.
