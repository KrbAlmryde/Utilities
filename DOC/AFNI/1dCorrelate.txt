Usage: 1dCorrelate [options] 1Dfile 1Dfile ...
------
 * Each input 1D column is a collection of data points; the correlation
   coefficient between each column pair is computed, along with its
   confidence interval.
 * The minimum column length is 7.
 * At least 2 columns are needed [in 1 or more .1D files].
 * If there are N input columns, there will be N*(N-1)/2 output rows.
 * Output appears on stdout; redirect as needed.
 * Only one correlation method can be used in one run of this program.
 * This program is basically the bastard offspring of program 1ddot.

-------
Methods   [actually, only the first letter is needed to choose a method]
-------   [and the case doesn't matter: '-P' and '-p' both = '-Pearson']
 -Pearson  = Pearson correlation                    [the default method]
 -Spearman = Spearman (rank) correlation      [more robust vs. outliers]
 -Quadrant = Quadrant (binarized) correlation  [most robust, but weaker]
 -Ktaub    = Kendall's tau_b 'correlation'    [popular somewhere, maybe]

-------------
Other Options  [these options cannot be abbreviated!]
-------------
 -nboot B  = Set the number of bootstrap replicates to 'B'.
             * The default (and minimum allowed) value of B is 4000.
             * A larger number will give somewhat more accurate
               confidence intervals, at the cost of more CPU time.

 -alpha A  = Set the 2-sided confidence interval width to '100-A' percent.
             * The default value of A is 5, giving the 2.5..97.5% interval.
             * The smallest allowed A is 1 (0.5%..99.5%) and the largest
               allowed value of A is 20 (10%..90%).

 -block    = Attempt to allow for serial correlation in the data by doing
   *OR*      variable-length block resampling, rather than completely
 -blk        random resampling as in the usual bootstrap.
             * You should NOT do this unless you believe that serial
               correlation (along each column) is present and significant.
             * Block resampling requires at least 20 data points in each
               input column.  Fewer than 20 will turn off this option.
-----
Notes
-----
* For each pair of columns, the output include the correlation value
  as directly calculated, plus the bias-corrected bootstrap value, and
  the desired (100-A)% confidence interval [also via bootstrap].

* The primary purpose of this program is to provide an easy way to get
  the bootstrap confidence intervals, since people almost always seem to use
  the asymptotic normal theory to decide if a correlation is 'significant',
  and this often seems misleading to me [especially for short columns].

* Bootstrapping confidence intervals for the inverse correlations matrix
  (i.e., partial correlations) would be interesting -- anyone out there
  need this ability?

Sample output  [command was '1dCorrelate -alpha 10 A2.1D B2.1D']
-------------
# Pearson correlation [n=12 #col=2]
# Name      Name       Value   BiasCorr   5.00%   95.00%  N: 5.00% N:95.00%
# --------  --------  -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
  A2.1D[0]  B2.1D[0]  +0.57254 +0.57225 -0.03826 +0.86306 +0.10265 +0.83353

* Bias correction of the correlation had little effect; this is very common.

* The correlation is not significant at this level, since the CI (confidence
  interval) includes 0 in its range.

* For the Pearson method ONLY, the last two columns ('N:', as above) also
  show the widely used asymptotic normal theory confidence interval.  As in
  the example, the bootstrap interval is often (but not always) wider than
  the theoretical interval.

* In the example, the normal theory might indicate that the correlation is
  significant (less than a 5% chance that the CI includes 0), but the
  bootstrap CI shows that is not a reasonable statistical conclusion.

* Using the same data with the '-S' option gives the table below, again
  indicating that there is no significant correlation between the columns
  (note the lack of the 'N:' results for Spearman correlation):

# Spearman correlation [n=12 #col=2]
# Name      Name       Value   BiasCorr   5.00%   95.00%
# --------  --------  -------- -------- -------- --------
  A2.1D[0]  B2.1D[0]  +0.46154 +0.42756 -0.23063 +0.86078
