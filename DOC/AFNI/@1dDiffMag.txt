Usage: @1dDiffMag file.1D
* Computes a magnitude estimate of the first differences of a 1D file.
* Differences are computed down each column.
* The result -- a single number -- is on stdout.
* But (I hear you say), what IS the result?
* For each column, the standard deviation of the first differences is computed.
* The final result is the square-root of the sum of the squares of these stdev values.
