Usage: 1dBandpass [options] fbot ftop infile

 * infile is an AFNI *.1D file; each column is processed
 * fbot = lowest frequency in the passband, in Hz
          [can be 0 if you want to do a lowpass filter only,]
           but the mean and Nyquist freq are always removed ]
 * ftop = highest frequency in the passband (must be > fbot)
          [if ftop > Nyquist freq, then we have a highpass filter only]
 * You cannot construct a 'notch' filter with this program!
 * Output vectors appear on stdout; redirect as desired
 * Program will fail if fbot and ftop are too close for comfort
 * The actual FFT length used will be printed, and may be larger
   than the input time series length for the sake of efficiency.

Options:
  -dt dd     = set time step to 'dd' sec [default = 1.0]
  -ort f.1D  = Also orthogonalize input to columns in f.1D
               [only one '-ort' option is allowed]
  -nodetrend = Skip the quadratic detrending of the input
  -norm      = Make output time series have L2 norm = 1

Example:
  1deval -num 1000 -expr 'gran(0,1)' > r1000.1D
  1dBandpass 0.025 0.20 r1000.1D  > f1000.1D
  1dfft f1000.1D - | 1dplot -del 0.000977 -stdin -plabel 'Filtered |FFT|'

Goal:
 * Mostly to test the functions in thd_bandpass.c -- RWCox -- May 2009

++ Compile date = Jul  5 2011
