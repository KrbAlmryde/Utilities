   Usage:    CompareSurfaces 
             -spec <Spec file>
             -hemi <L or R>
             -sv1 <volparentaligned1.BRIK>
             -sv2 <volparentaligned2.BRIK> 
             [-prefix <fileprefix>]

   NOTE: This program is now superseded by SurfToSurf

   This program calculates the distance, at each node in Surface 1 (S1) to Surface 2 (S2)
   The distances are computed along the local surface normal at each node in S1.
   S1 and S2 are the first and second surfaces encountered in the spec file, respectively.

   -spec <Spec file>: File containing surface specification. This file is typically 
                      generated by @SUMA_Make_Spec_FS (for FreeSurfer surfaces) or 
                      @SUMA_Make_Spec_SF (for SureFit surfaces).
   -hemi <left or right>: specify the hemisphere being processed 
   -sv1 <volume parent BRIK>:volume parent BRIK for first surface 
   -sv2 <volume parent BRIK>:volume parent BRIK for second surface 

Optional parameters:
   [-prefix <fileprefix>]: Prefix for distance and node color output files.
                           Existing file will not be overwritten.
   [-onenode <index>]: output results for node index only. 
                       This option is for debugging.
   [-noderange <istart> <istop>]: output results from node istart to node istop only. 
                                  This option is for debugging.
   NOTE: -noderange and -onenode are mutually exclusive
   [-nocons]: Skip mesh orientation consistency check.
              This speeds up the start time so it is useful
              for debugging runs.

   [-novolreg|-noxform]: Ignore any Rotate, Volreg, Tagalign, 
                or WarpDrive transformations present in 
                the Surface Volume.
  Common Debugging Options:
   [-trace]: Turns on In/Out debug and Memory tracing.
             For speeding up the tracing log, I recommend 
             you redirect stdout to a file when using this option.
             For example, if you were running suma you would use:
             suma -spec lh.spec -sv ... > TraceFile
             This option replaces the old -iodbg and -memdbg.
   [-TRACE]: Turns on extreme tracing.
   [-nomall]: Turn off memory tracing.
   [-yesmall]: Turn on memory tracing (default).
  NOTE: For programs that output results to stdout
    (that is to your shell/screen), the debugging info
    might get mixed up with your results.
