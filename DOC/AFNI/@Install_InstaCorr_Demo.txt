Installs and sets up AFNI's InstaCorr demo archive
After setup, all you need to do is run the demo scripts
this way:
*****************

For Volume-based 3dGroupInCorr run:
cd /usr/local/utilities/Documentation/AFNI/AFNI_InstaCorrDemo/vol
tcsh ./@RunVolGroupInCorr 

For Surface-based 3dGroupInCorr run:
cd /usr/local/utilities/Documentation/AFNI/AFNI_InstaCorrDemo/srf
tcsh ./@RunSurfGroupInCorr 

For Surface-based Single-Subject InstaCorr run:
cd /usr/local/utilities/Documentation/AFNI/AFNI_InstaCorrDemo/srf
tcsh ./@RunSingleSurfInstaCorr 

*****************

It taks a while to download, unpack, and run the setup scripts
