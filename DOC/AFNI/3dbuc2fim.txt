This program converts bucket sub-bricks to fim (fico, fitt, fift, ...)
type dataset.                                                       

Usage:                                                              

3dbuc2fim  -prefix pname  d1+orig[index]                              
     This produces a fim dataset.                                   

 -or-                                                               

3dbuc2fim  -prefix pname  d1+orig[index1]  d2+orig[index2]            
     This produces a fico (fitt, fift, ...) dataset,                  
     depending on the statistic type of the 2nd subbrick,             
     with   d1+orig[index1] -> intensity sub-brick of pname           
            d2+orig[index2] -> threshold sub-brick of pname         

 -or-                                                               

3dbuc2fim  -prefix pname  d1+orig[index1,index2]                      
     This produces a fico (fitt, fift, ...) dataset,                  
     depending on the statistic type of the 2nd subbrick,             
     with   d1+orig[index1] -> intensity sub-brick of pname           
            d1+orig[index2] -> threshold sub-brick of pname         

where the options are:
     -prefix pname = Use 'pname' for the output dataset prefix name.
 OR  -output pname     [default='buc2fim']

     -session dir  = Use 'dir' for the output dataset session directory.
                       [default='./'=current working directory]
     -verb         = Print out some verbose output as the program
                       proceeds 

Command line arguments after the above are taken as input datasets.  
A dataset is specified using one of these forms:
   'prefix+view', 'prefix+view.HEAD', or 'prefix+view.BRIK'.
Sub-brick indexes start at 0. 

N.B.: The sub-bricks are output in the order specified, which may
 not be the order in the original datasets.  For example, using
           fred+orig[5,3]
 will cause the sub-brick #5 in fred+orig to be output as the intensity
 sub-brick, and sub-brick #3 to be output as the threshold sub-brick 
 in the new dataset.

N.B.: The '$', '(', ')', '[', and ']' characters are special to
 the shell, so you will have to escape them.  This is most easily
 done by putting the entire dataset plus selection list inside
 single quotes, as in 'fred+orig[5,9]'.
