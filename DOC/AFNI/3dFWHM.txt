This program estimates the Filter Width Half Maximum (FWHM).  

3dFWHM itself will no longer be upgraded.  Any future improvements
will be made to 3dFWHMx.  **** PLEASE SWITCH TO THAT PROGRAM ****

Usage: 
3dFWHM 
-dset file     file  = name of input AFNI 3d dataset 
[-mask mname]  mname = filename of 3d mask dataset   
[-quiet]       suppress screen output                
[-out file]    file  = name of output file           

[-compat] = Be compatible with the older 3dFWHM, where if a
            voxel is in the mask, then its neighbors are used
            for differencing, even if they are not themselves in
            the mask.  This was an error; now, neighbors must also
            be in the mask to be used in the differencing.
            Use '-compat' to use the older method [for comparison].
         ** This change made 09 Nov 2006.

ALSO SEE:
 - 3dFWHMx, which can deal with multi-brick datasets
 - 3dLocalstat -stat FWHM, which can estimate the FWHM at each voxel
3dFWHM itself will no longer be upgraded.  Any future improvements
will be made to 3dFWHMx.  **** PLEASE SWITCH TO THAT PROGRAM ****

INPUT FILE RECOMMENDATIONS:
For FMRI statistical purposes, you DO NOT want the FWHM to reflect
the spatial structure of the underlying anatomy.  Rather, you want
the FWHM to reflect the spatial structure of the noise.  This means
that the input dataset should not have anatomical structure.  One
good form of input is the output of '3dDeconvolve -errts', which is
the residuals left over after the GLM fitted signal model is subtracted
out from each voxel's time series.  If you don't want to go to that
trouble, use the output of 3dDetrend for the same purpose.  But just
giving a raw EPI dataset to this program will produce un-useful values.


INPUT DATASET NAMES
-------------------
This program accepts datasets that are modified on input according to the
following schemes:
  'r1+orig[3..5]'                                    {sub-brick selector}
  'r1+orig<100..200>'                                {sub-range selector}
  'r1+orig[3..5]<100..200>'                          {both selectors}
  '3dcalc( -a r1+orig -b r2+orig -expr 0.5*(a+b) )'  {calculation}
For the gruesome details, see the output of 'afni -help'.
