-nt n            n = length of time series                             
-num_stimts p    p = number of input stimuli (experimental conditions) 
[-nblock i k]    k = block length for stimulus i  (1<=i<=p)            
                     (default: k = 1)                                  
[-seed s]        s = random number seed                                
[-quiet]         flag to suppress screen output                        
[-one_file]      place stimulus functions into a single .1D file       
[-one_col]       write stimulus functions as a single column of decimal
                   integers (default: multiple columns of binary nos.) 
[-prefix pname]  pname = prefix for p output .1D stimulus functions    
                   e.g., pname1.1D, pname2.1D, ..., pnamep.1D          
                                                                       
The following Random Permutation, Markov Chain, and Input Table options
are mutually exclusive.                                                
                                                                       
Random Permutation options:                                            
-nreps i r       r = number of repetitions for stimulus i  (1<=i<=p)   
[-pseed s]       s = stim label permutation random number seed         
                                     p                                 
                 Note: Require n >= Sum (r[i] * k[i])                  
                                    i=1                                
                                                                       
Markov Chain options:                                                  
-markov mfile    mfile = file containing the transition prob. matrix   
[-pzero z]       probability of a zero (i.e., null) state              
                     (default: z = 0)                                  
                                                                       
Input Table row permutation options:                                   
[-table dfile]   dfile = filename of column or table of numbers        
                 Note: dfile may have a column selector attached       
                 Note: With this option, all other input options,      
                       except -seed and -prefix, are ignored           
                                                                       
                                                                       
Warning: This program will overwrite pre-existing .1D files
