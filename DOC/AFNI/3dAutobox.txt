Usage: 3dAutobox [options] DATASET
Computes size of a box that fits around the volume.
Also can be used to crop the volume to that box.
Optional parameters are:
-prefix PREFIX: Crop the input dataset to the size of the box.
                If left empty no new volume is written out.
-input DATASET: An alternate way to specify the input dataset.
                The default method is to pass DATASET as
                the last parameter on the command line.
-noclust      : Don't do any clustering to find box. Any non-zero
                voxel will be preserved in cropped volume.
                The default uses some clustering to find cropping
