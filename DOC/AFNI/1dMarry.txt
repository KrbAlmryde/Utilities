Usage: 1dMarry [options] file1 file2 ...

  Joins together 2 (or more) ragged-right .1D files, for use with
    3dDeconvolve -stim_times_AM2.
 **_OR_**
  Breaks up 1 married file into 2 (or more) single-valued files.

OPTIONS:
=======
 -sep abc  == Use the first character (e.g., 'a') as the separator
              between values 1 and 2, the second character (e.g., 'b')
              as the separator between values 2 and 3, etc.
            * These characters CANNOT be a blank, a tab, a digit,
              or a non-printable control character!
            * Default separator string is '*,' which will result
              in output similar to '3*4,5,6'

 -divorce  == Instead of marrying the files, assume that file1
              is already a married file: split time*value*value... tuples
              into separate files, and name them in the pattern
              'file2_A.1D' 'file2_B.1D' et cetera.

If not divorcing, the 'married' file is written to stdout, and
probably should be captured using a redirection such as '>'.

NOTES:
=====
* You cannot use column [...] or row {...} selectors on
    ragged-right .1D files, so don't even think about trying!
* The maximum number of values that can be married is 26.
    (No polygamy or polyandry jokes here, please.)
* For debugging purposes, with '-divorce', if 'file2' is '-',
    then all the divorcees are written directly to stdout.
