--- afni Interactive steps (partial introduction to the afni GUI) ---

Tasks:
A. locate data, peruse main afni GUI
  1. go to AFNI_data6/afni and verify there are datasets
        --> cd ~/AFNI_data6/afni ; ls ; afni &
  2. quickly peruse the main window
        - coords, Ulay Image/Graph buttons, BHelp, -> panel toggle buttons

B. examine anat+orig as underlay
  1. set anat+orig as Underlay, open windows, open/close graph
  2. note xhairs, cardinal views, contrast/brightness controls (mouse/buttons)
  3. compare against Min-to-Max display (in Disp window)
  4. zoom, pan, crop
  5. other menus: right-click in image and in color bar

C. review alignment between anat+orig and epi_r1_orig
  1. set epi_r1+orig as Overlay
  2. look at edges, CSF (jump-to-xyz: 20 8 57)
  3. turn off/on overlay (toggle button and get 'o' from F1 help)
  4. threshold overlay

D. review time series, look for motion or other problems
  1. set epi_r1+orig as Underlay, turn off overlay
  2. note graph information, graph size and relation to Image window
        - note Opt->Scale/Matrix and keyboard shortcuts
  3. jump-to-ijk: 22 27 16 (via right-click in image)
  4. ignore 3 TRs (FIM -> Ignore)
  5. evaluate motion : 'v'ideo mode (space to stop), arrows
  6. pick ideal: (FIM -> Pick Ideal -> epi_r1_ideal.1D)
  7. jump-to-ijk: 20 67 16 (via right-click in image)

E. overlay statistics: evaluate full-F and maybe fpos stimulus
  1. set func_slim+orig as overlay, Full_Fstat as both OLay, Thr
  2. set threshold to 7.0, evaluate colored/uncolored voxels
        - note Thr range and individual voxel values
  3. evaluate colors of voxels, Inten range, OLay range, scalar, Pos button
        - note color at individual voxels
        - alter one panel range and color
  4. set thresh -> 12.0, simple Clusterize, look at report (Rpt)
  5. (optional) 4x3x2 coronal montage around peak F, save .jpg image
  6. change OLay, Thr sub-bricks to 1,2 (Vrel Coef and Tstat)
        - set p=0.001, note q
        - set color range to 2, 7 Positive colors
        - change one color panel range and color
  7. (optional) 3 hidden menus (note cursor color), consider other color bars

------------- optional, continued ------------------------------------

F. (optional) histogram plugin: 
  1. strip+orig, note background, CSF, gray and white peaks
        - plot, range 100-4000, 100 bins
  
G. (optional) dataset information: how was func_slim created?
  1. Define Databmode -> Misc -> OLay info
  2. note orientation, extents, HISTORY and sub-brick contents

H. (optional) standard space:
  1. where is the peak F-stat?
        - Underlay -> anat, and switch to "Talairach View"
        - Image window -> right click -> Where Am I?
  2. Atlas Colors: hippocampus -> blue, amygdala -> red
