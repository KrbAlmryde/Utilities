Usage: 3dAFNItoNIML [options] dset
 Dumps AFNI dataset header information to stdout in NIML format.
 Mostly for debugging and testing purposes!

 OPTIONS:
  -data          == Also put the data into the output (will be huge).
  -ascii         == Format in ASCII, not binary (even huger).
  -tcp:host:port == Instead of stdout, send the dataset to a socket.
                    (implies '-data' as well)
