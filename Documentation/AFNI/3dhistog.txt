Compute histogram of 3D Dataset
Usage: 3dhistog [editing options] [histogram options] dataset

The editing options are the same as in 3dmerge
 (i.e., the options starting with '-1').

The histogram options are:
  -nbin #   Means to use '#' bins [default=100]
            Special Case: for short or byte dataset bricks,
                          set '#' to zero to have the number
                          of bins set by the brick range.
  -dind i   Means to take data from sub-brick #i, rather than #0
  -omit x   Means to omit the value 'x' from the count;
              -omit can be used more than once to skip multiple values.
  -mask m   Means to use dataset 'm' to determine which voxels to use
  -roi_mask r Means to create a histogram for each non-zero value in 
              dataset 'r'. If -mask option is also used, dataset 'r' is 
              masked by 'm' before creating the histograms.
  -doall    Means to include all sub-bricks in the calculation;
              otherwise, only sub-brick #0 (or that from -dind) is used.
  -notit    Means to leave the title line off the output.
  -log10    Output log10() of the counts, instead of the count values.
  -min x    Means specify minimum of histogram.
  -max x    Means specify maximum of histogram.
  -unq U.1D Writes out the sorted unique values to file U.1D.
            This option is not allowed for float data
            If you have a problem with this, write

  -prefix HOUT: Write a copy of the histogram into file HOUT.1D
                you can plot the file with:
             1dplot -sepscl -x HOUT.1D'[0]' HOUT.1D'[1,2]' 
        or   
             1dRplot -input HOUT.1D

Without -prefix, the histogram is written to stdout.  
Use redirection '>' if you want to save it to a file.
The format is a title line, then three numbers printed per line:
  bottom-of-interval  count-in-interval  cumulative-count

INPUT DATASET NAMES
-------------------
This program accepts datasets that are modified on input according to the
following schemes:
  'r1+orig[3..5]'                                    {sub-brick selector}
  'r1+orig<100..200>'                                {sub-range selector}
  'r1+orig[3..5]<100..200>'                          {both selectors}
  '3dcalc( -a r1+orig -b r2+orig -expr 0.5*(a+b) )'  {calculation}
For the gruesome details, see the output of 'afni -help'.
