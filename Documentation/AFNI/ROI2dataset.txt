Usage: 
   ROI2dataset <-prefix dsetname> [...] <-input ROI1 ROI2 ...>
               [<-of ni_bi|ni_as|1D>] 
               [<-dom_par_id idcode>] 
    This program transforms a series of ROI files
    to a node dataset. This data set will contain
    the node indices in the first column and their
    ROI values in the second column.
    Duplicate node entries (nodes that are part of
    multiple ROIs) will get ignored. You will be
    notified when this occurs. 

Mandatory parameters:
    -prefix     dsetname: Prefix of output dataset.
                          Program will not overwrite existing
                          datasets.
                          See also -label_dset alternate below.

 and/or
    -nodelist        NL: Prefix for a set of .1D files
    -nodelist.nodups NL: that contain a list of node indices
                         in the order in which they appear in
                         an ROI. This way you can make use of the
                         directionality of an ROI line instead of just 
                         treating it as a set of nodes. 
                         For each integer label 'i' in the ROI files provided
                         with the -input option, you will get a file called
                         NL.i.1D listing the nodes in the order they were 
                         encountered in an ROI file and across ROI files.
                         If you want duplicate node entries removed, then
                         use -nodelist.nodups instead.
                   Note: You can use the output of -nodelist as input to 
                         ConvertDset's -node_select_1D option. 
                         This is not the case for -nodelist.nodups because
                         ConvertDset's -node_select_1D does allow for 
                         duplicate node entries. 
    -input ROI1 ROI2....: ROI files to turn into a 
                          data set. This parameter MUST
                          be the last one on command line.

Optional parameters:
    All optional parameters must be specified before the -input parameters.

    -label_dset dsetname: Write a label dataset, instead of a simple dataset.
                          Labeled datasets are treated differently in SUMA.
                          This option also sets the output format to NIML.
    -h | -help: This help message
    -of FORMAT: Output format of dataset. FORMAT is one of:
                ni_bi: NIML binary
                ni_as: NIML ascii (default)
                1D   : 1D AFNI format.
    -dom_par_id id: Idcode of domain parent.
                    When specified, only ROIs have the same
                    domain parent are included in the output.
                    If id is not specified then the first
                    domain parent encountered in the ROI list
                    is adopted as dom_par_id.
                    1D roi files do not have domain parent 
                    information. They will be added to the 
                    output data under the chosen dom_par_id.
    -pad_to_node max_index: Output a full dset from node 0 
                            to node max_index (a total of 
                            max_index + 1 nodes). Nodes that
                            are not part of any ROI will get
                            a default label of 0 unless you
                            specify your own padding label.
    -pad_label padding_label: Use padding_label (an integer) to
                            label nodes that do not belong
                            to any ROI. Default is 0.
