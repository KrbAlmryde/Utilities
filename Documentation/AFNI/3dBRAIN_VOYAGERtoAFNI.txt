Usage: 3dBRAIN_VOYAGERtoAFNI <-input BV_VOLUME.vmr> 
                             [-bs] [-qx] [-tlrc|-acpc|-orig] [<-prefix PREFIX>]
 
 Converts a BrainVoyager vmr dataset to AFNI's BRIK format
 The conversion is based on information from BrainVoyager's
 website: www.brainvoyager.com. 
 Sample data and information provided by 
  Adam Greenberg and Nikolaus Kriegeskorte.

  If you get error messages about the number of
 voxels and file size, try the options below.
 I hope to automate these options once I have
 a better description of the BrainVoyager QX format.

  Optional Parameters:
  -bs: Force byte swapping.
  -qx: .vmr file is from BrainVoyager QX
  -tlrc: dset in tlrc space
  -acpc: dset in acpc-aligned space
  -orig: dset in orig space
  If unspecified, the program attempts to guess the view from
  the name of the input.
   [-novolreg|-noxform]: Ignore any Rotate, Volreg, Tagalign, 
                or WarpDrive transformations present in 
                the Surface Volume.
  Common Debugging Options:
   [-trace]: Turns on In/Out debug and Memory tracing.
             For speeding up the tracing log, I recommend 
             you redirect stdout to a file when using this option.
             For example, if you were running suma you would use:
             suma -spec lh.spec -sv ... > TraceFile
             This option replaces the old -iodbg and -memdbg.
   [-TRACE]: Turns on extreme tracing.
   [-nomall]: Turn off memory tracing.
   [-yesmall]: Turn on memory tracing (default).
  NOTE: For programs that output results to stdout
    (that is to your shell/screen), the debugging info
    might get mixed up with your results.
