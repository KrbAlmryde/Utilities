Convert a set of 0/1 stim files into a set of stim_times files, or
convert real-valued files into those for use with -stim_times_AM2.

Each input stim file can have a set of columns of stim classes,
     and multiple input files can be used.  Each column of an
     input file is expected to have one row per TR, and a total
     of num_TRs * num_runs rows.

     The user must provide -files, -prefix, -nruns, -nt and -tr,
     where NT * NRUNS should equal (or be less than) the number
     of TR lines in each file.

Note: Since the output times are LOCAL (one row per run) in the
     eyes of 3dDeconvolve, any file where the first stimulus is
     the only stimulus in that run will have '*' appended to that
     line, so 3dDeconvolve would treat it as a multi-run file.

Sample stim_file with 3 stim classes over 7 TRs:

        0       0       0
        1       0       0
        0       1       0
        0       1       0
        1       0       0
        0       0       0
        0       0       1

Corresponding stim_times files, assume TR = 2.5 seconds:

        stim.01.1D:     2.5 10
        stim.02.1D:     5    7.5
        stim.03.1D:     15

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options: -files file1.1D file2.1D ...   : specify stim files
         -prefix PREFIX                 : output prefix for files
         -nruns  NRUNS                  : number of runs
         -nt     NT                     : number of TRs per run
         -tr     TR                     : TR time, in seconds
         -offset OFFSET                 : add OFFSET to all output times
         -labels LAB1 LAB2 ...          : provide labels for filenames
         -show_valid_opts               : output all options
         -verb   LEVEL                  : provide verbose output

complex options:
         -amplitudes                    : "marry" times with amplitudes

                This is to make files for -stim_times_AM1 or -stim_times_AM2
                in 3dDeconvolve (for 2-parameter amplitude modulation).

                With this option, the output files do not just contain times,
                they contain values in the format 'time*amplitude', where the
                amplitude is the non-zero value in the input file.

                For example, the input might look like:

                   0
                   2.4
                   0
                   0
                   -1.2

                On a TR=2.5 grid, this would (skip zeros as usual and) output:

                   2.5*2.4 10*-1.2

examples:

    1. Given 3 stimulus classes, A, B and C, each with a single column
       file spanning 7 runs (with some number of TRs per run), create
       3 stim_times files (stimes.01.1D, stimes.02.1D, stimes.02.1D)
       having the times, in seconds, of the stimuli, one run per row.

            make_stim_times.py -files stimA.1D stimB.1D stimC.1D   \
                               -prefix stimes1 -tr 2.5 -nruns 7 -nt 100

    2. Same as 1, but suppose stim_all.1D has all 3 stim types (so 3 columns).

            make_stim_times.py -files stim_all.1D -prefix stimes2 -tr 2.5 \
                               -nruns 7 -nt 100

    3. Same as 2, but the stimuli were presented at the middle of the TR, so
       add 1.25 seconds to each stimulus time.

            make_stim_times.py -files stim_all.1D -prefix stimes3 -tr 2.5 \
                               -nruns 7 -nt 100 -offset 1.25

    4. An appropriate conversion of stim_files to stim_times for the 
       example in AFNI_data2 (HowTo #5).  The labels will appear in the
       resulting filenames.

            make_stim_times.py -prefix stim_times -tr 1.0 -nruns 10 -nt 272 \
                           -files misc_files/all_stims.1D                   \
                           -labels ToolMovie HumanMovie ToolPoint HumanPoint

    5. Generate files for 2-term amplitude modulation in 3dDeconvolve (i.e.
       for use with -stim_times_AM2).  For any TR that has a non-zero value
       in the input, the output will have that current time along with the
       non-zero amplitude value in the format time:value.

       Just add -amplitudes to any existing command.

            make_stim_times.py -files stim_weights.1D -prefix stimes5 -tr 2.5 \
                               -nruns 7 -nt 100 -amplitudes
