Usage: SurfDsetInfo [options] -input DSET1 -input DSET2 ...
   or: SurfDsetInfo [options] DSET1 DSET2 ... 
   Optional Params:
      -debug DBG: if DBG = 2, show dset->ngr in its entirety in NIML form.

  SUMA dataset input options:
      -input DSET: Read DSET1 as input.
                   In programs accepting multiple input datasets
                   you can use -input DSET1 -input DSET2 or 
                   input DSET1 DSET2 ...
       NOTE: Selecting subsets of a dataset:
             Much like in AFNI, you can select subsets of a dataset
             by adding qualifiers to DSET.
           Append #SEL# to select certain nodes.
           Append [SEL] to select certain columns.
           Append {SEL} to select certain rows.
           The format of SEL is the same as in AFNI, see section:
           'INPUT DATASET NAMES' in 3dcalc -help for details.
           Append [i] to get the node index column from
                      a niml formatted dataset.
           *  SUMA does not preserve the selection order 
              for any of the selectors.
              For example:
              dset[44,10..20] is the same as dset[10..20,44]
              Also, duplicate values are not supported.
              so dset[13, 13] is the same as dset[13].
              I am not proud of these limitations, someday I'll get
              around to fixing them.


   [-novolreg|-noxform]: Ignore any Rotate, Volreg, Tagalign, 
                or WarpDrive transformations present in 
                the Surface Volume.
  Common Debugging Options:
   [-trace]: Turns on In/Out debug and Memory tracing.
             For speeding up the tracing log, I recommend 
             you redirect stdout to a file when using this option.
             For example, if you were running suma you would use:
             suma -spec lh.spec -sv ... > TraceFile
             This option replaces the old -iodbg and -memdbg.
   [-TRACE]: Turns on extreme tracing.
   [-nomall]: Turn off memory tracing.
   [-yesmall]: Turn on memory tracing (default).
  NOTE: For programs that output results to stdout
    (that is to your shell/screen), the debugging info
    might get mixed up with your results.
