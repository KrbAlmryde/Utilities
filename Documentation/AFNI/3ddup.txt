Usage: 3ddup [options] dataset
 'Duplicates' a 3D dataset by making a warp-on-demand copy.
 Applications:
   - allows AFNI to resample a dataset to a new grid without
       destroying an existing data .BRIK
   - change a functional dataset to anatomical, or vice-versa
   - THIS PROGRAM IS BASICALLY OBSOLETE !!

OPTIONS:
  -'type'           = Convert to the given 'type', which must be
                       chosen from the same list as in to3d
  -session dirname  = Write output into given directory (default=./)
  -prefix  pname    = Use 'pname' for the output directory prefix
                       (default=dup)
N.B.: Even if the new dataset is anatomical, it will not contain
      any markers, duplicated from the original, or otherwise.
