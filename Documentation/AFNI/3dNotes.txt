Explanation of Options:
---------------------- 
   dataset       : AFNI compatible dataset [required].
                                                                        
   -a   "str"  : Add the string "str" to the list of notes.
                                                                        
                   Note that you can use the standard C escape codes,
                   \n for newline \t for tab, etc.
                                                                        
   -h   "str"   : Append the string "str" to the dataset's history.  This
                    can only appear once on the command line.  As this is
                    added to the history, it cannot easily be deleted. But,
                    history is propagated to the children of this dataset.
                                                                        
   -HH  "str"   : Replace any existing history note with "str".  This 
                    line cannot be used with '-h'.
                                                                        
   -d   num       : deletes note number num.
                                                                        
   -ses           : Print to stdout the expanded notes.                 
                                                                        
   -help          : Displays this screen.
                                                                        
                                                                        
The default action, with no options, is to display the notes for the
dataset.  If there are options, all deletions occur first and essentially
simultaneously.  Then, notes are added in the order listed on the command
line.  If you do something like -d 10 -d 10, it will delete both notes 10
and 11.  Don't do that.
