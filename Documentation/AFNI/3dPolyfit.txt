Usage: 3dPolyfit [options] dataset
Fits a polynomial in space to the dataset and outputs that.

Options:
  -nord n    = Maximum polynomial order (0..9) [default order=3]
  -blur f    = Gaussian blur (inside mask) with FWHM='f' (mm)
  -mrad r    = Radius (voxels) of preliminary median filter
                [default is no blurring of either type; you can]
                [do both types (Gaussian and median), but why??]
                [N.B.: median blur is much slower than Gaussian]
  -prefix pp = Use 'pp' for prefix of output dataset
  -automask  = Create a mask (a la 3dAutomask)
  -mask mset = Create a mask from nonzero voxels in 'mset'.
  -mone      = Scale the mean value of the fit (inside the mask) to 1.
  -mclip     = Clip values outside the box containing the mask
               to the edge of the box, to avoid weird artifacts.
  -meth mm   = Set 'mm' to 2 for least squares fit;
               set it to 1 for L1 fit [default method=2]
  -verb      = Print fun and useful progress reports :-)

Output dataset is always stored in float format.  If the input
dataset has more than 1 sub-brick, only sub-brick #0 is processed.
