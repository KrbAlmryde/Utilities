Usage: plugout_drive [-host name] [-v]
This program connects to AFNI and sends commands
 that the user specifies interactively or on command line
 over to AFNI to be executed.

Options:
  -host name    Means to connect to AFNI running on the computer
                'name' using TCP/IP.  The default is to connect
                on the current host 'localhost' using TCP/IP.

  -shm          Means to connect to the current host using shared
                memory.  There is no reason to do this unless
                you are transferring huge quantities of data.
                N.B.:  '-host .' is equivalent to '-shm'.

  -v            Verbose mode.

  -port pp      Use TCP/IP port number 'pp'.  The default is
                8099, but if two plugouts are running on the
                same computer, they must use different ports.
                For a list of currently used ports use afni -list_ports

  -maxwait t    Wait a maximum of 't' seconds for AFNI to connect;
                if the connection doesn't happen in that time, exit.
                [default wait time is 9 seconds]

  -name sss     Use the string 'sss' for the name that AFNI assigns
                to this plugout.  The default is something stupid.

  -com 'ACTION DATA'  Execute the following command. For example:
                       -com 'SET_FUNCTION SomeFunction'
                       will switch AFNI's function (overlay) to
                       dataset with prefix SomeFunction. 
                      Make sure ACTION and DATA are together enclosed
                       in one pair of single quotes.
                      There are numerous actions listed in AFNI's
                       README.driver file.
                      You can use the option -com repeatedly. 

  -quit         Quit after you are done with all the -com commands.
                The default is for the program to wait for more
                commands to be typed at the terminal's prompt.

NOTES:
You will need to turn plugouts on in AFNI using one of the
following methods: 
 1. Including '-yesplugouts' as an option on AFNI's command line
 2. From AFNI GUI: Define Datamode->Misc->Start Plugouts
 3. From AFNI GUI: Press the 'NIML+PO' button (near 'Overlay')
 4. Set environment variable AFNI_YESPLUGOUTS to YES in .afnirc
Otherwise, AFNI won't be listening for a plugout connection.
  [AFNI does't listen for socket connections, unless]
  [it is told to,  in order to avoid the overhead of]
  [checking for incoming data every few milliseconds]

This program's exit status will be 1 if it couldn't connect
to AFNI at all.  Otherwise, the exit status will be 0.
You could use this feature in a script to check if a copy of
AFNI is ready to rumble, and if not then start one, as in the
following csh fragment:
    plugout_drive -maxwait 1 -com 'OPEN_WINDOW axialimage'
    if( $status == 1 )then
      afni -yesplugouts &
      sleep 2 ; plugout_drive -com 'OPEN_WINDOW axialimage'
    endif

To have different plugout_* programs talking to different
AFNI, use the -np* options below
   -np PORT_OFFSET: Provide a port offset to allow multiple instances of
                    AFNI <--> SUMA, AFNI <--> 3dGroupIncorr, or any other
                    programs that communicate together to operate on the same
                    machine. 
                    All ports are assigned numbers relative to PORT_OFFSET.
         The same PORT_OFFSET value must be used on all programs
           that are to talk together. PORT_OFFSET is an integer in
           the inclusive range [1025 to 65500]. 
         When you want to use multiple instances of communicating programs, 
           be sure the PORT_OFFSETS you use differ by about 50 or you may
           still have port conflicts. A BETTER approach is to use -npb below.
   -npq PORT_OFFSET: Like -np, but more quiet in the face of adversity.
   -npb PORT_OFFSET_BLOC: Simliar to -np, except it is easier to use.
                          PORT_OFFSET_BLOC is an integer between 0 and
                          MAX_BLOC. MAX_BLOC is around 4000 for now, but
                          it might decrease as we use up more ports in AFNI.
                          You should be safe for the next 10 years if you 
                          stay under 2000.
                          Using this function reduces your chances of causing
                          port conflicts.

         See also afni and suma options: -list_ports and -port_number for 
            information about port number assignments.

         You can also provide a port offset with the environment variable
            AFNI_PORT_OFFSET. Using -np overrides AFNI_PORT_OFFSET.

   -max_port_bloc: Print the current value of MAX_BLOC and exit.
                   Remember this value can get smaller with future releases.
                   Stay under 2000.
   -max_port_bloc_quiet: Spit MAX_BLOC value only and exit.
   -num_assigned_ports: Print the number of assigned ports used by AFNI 
                        then quit.
   -num_assigned_ports_quiet: Do it quietly.

     Port Handling Examples:
     -----------------------
         Say you want to run three instances of AFNI <--> SUMA.
         For the first you just do: 
            suma -niml -spec ... -sv ...  &
            afni -niml &
         Then for the second instance pick an offset bloc, say 1 and run
            suma -niml -npb 1 -spec ... -sv ...  &
            afni -niml -npb 1 &
         And for yet another instance:
            suma -niml -npb 2 -spec ... -sv ...  &
            afni -niml -npb 2 &
         etc.

         Since you can launch many instances of communicating programs now,
            you need to know wich SUMA window, say, is talking to which AFNI.
            To sort this out, the titlebars now show the number of the bloc 
            of ports they are using. When the bloc is set either via 
            environment variables AFNI_PORT_OFFSET or AFNI_PORT_BLOC, or  
            with one of the -np* options, window title bars change from 
            [A] to [A#] with # being the resultant bloc number.
         In the examples above, both AFNI and SUMA windows will show [A2]
            when -npb is 2.
