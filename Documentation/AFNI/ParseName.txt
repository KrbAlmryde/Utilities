Usage:  ParseName [OPTIONS] <FName> 
Parses filename FName into components useful for AFNI
The program makes no attempt to check that the file exists.
OPTIONS:
   -cwd: Specify the working directory, from which relative
         path is constructed. Default is the program's CWD   -out OUT: Output only one component of the parsed file name
             By default the whole parsed filename structure is
             displayed.
             OUT is one of the following:
        FullName: ABSOLUTE_PATH/FName
        RelName : RELATIVE_PATH/FName
        AbsPath : ABSOLUTE_PATH/
        RelPath : RELATIVE_PATH/

Tests:
    ParseName -cwd /hello/Joe /hello/Joe/afni.c
    ParseName -cwd /hello/Joe/ /hello/Jane/afni.c
