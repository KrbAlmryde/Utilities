Usage: 1dcat [options] a.1D b.1D ...
  where each file a.1D, b.1D, etc. is a 1D file.
  In the simplest form, a 1D file is an ASCII file of numbers
  arranged in rows and columns.

1dcat takes as input one or more 1D files, and writes out a 1D file
containing the side-by-side concatenation of all or a subset of the
columns from the input files.

* Output goes to stdout (the screen); redirect (e.g., '>') to save elsewhere.
* All files MUST have the same number of rows!
* Any header lines (i.e., lines that start with '#') will be lost.
* For generic 1D file usage help and information, see '1dplot -help'

OPTIONS:
--------
The '-nonconst' option indicates that columns that are identically
constant should be omitted from the output.

The '-nonfixed' option indicates to keep only columns that are
marked as 'free' in the 3dAllineate header from '-1Dparam_save'.
If there is no such header, all columns are kept.

The '-form' option indicates the format of the numbers to be output.
For help on -form's usage, see ccalc's help for the option of the same name.
