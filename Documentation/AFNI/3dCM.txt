Usage: 3dCM [options] dset
Output = center of mass of dataset, to stdout.
  -mask mset   Means to use the dataset 'mset' as a mask:
                 Only voxels with nonzero values in 'mset'
                 will be averaged from 'dataset'.  Note
                 that the mask dataset and the input dataset
                 must have the same number of voxels.
  -automask    Generate the mask automatically.
  -set x y z   After computing the CM of the dataset, set the
                 origin fields in the header so that the CM
                 will be at (x,y,z) in DICOM coords.
