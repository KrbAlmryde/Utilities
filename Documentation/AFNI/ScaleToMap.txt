    -input IntFile icol vcol: input data.
       Infile: 1D formatted ascii file containing node values
       icol: index of node index column 
       (-1 if the node index is implicit)
       vcol: index of node value column.
       Example: -input ValOnly.1D -1 0 
       for a 1D file containing node values
       in the first column and no node indices.
       Example: -input NodeVal.1D 1 3
       for a 1D file containing node indices in
       the SECOND column and node values in the 
       FOURTH column (index counting begins at 0)
    -v and -iv options are now obsolete.
       Use -input option instead.
    -cmap MapName: (optional, default RGYBR20) 
       choose one of the standard colormaps available with SUMA:
       RGYBR20, BGYR19, BW20, GRAY20, MATLAB_DEF_BYR64, 
       ROI64, ROI128
       You can also use AFNI's default paned color maps:
       The maps are labeled according to the number of 
       panes and their sign. Example: afni_p10
       uses the positive 10-pane afni colormap.
       afni_n10 is the negative counterpart.
       These maps are meant to be used with
       the options -apr and -anr listed below.
       You can also load non-default AFNI colormaps
       from .pal files (AFNI's colormap format); see option
       -cmapdb below.
    -cmapdb Palfile: read color maps from AFNI .pal file
       In addition to the default paned AFNI colormaps, you
       can load colormaps from a .pal file.
       To access maps in the Palfile you must use the -cmap option
       with the label formed by the name of the palette, its sign
       and the number of panes. For example, to following palette:
       ***PALETTES deco [13]
       should be accessed with -cmap deco_n13
       ***PALETTES deco [13+]
       should be accessed with -cmap deco_p13
    -cmapfile Mapfile: read color map from Mapfile.
       Mapfile:1D formatted ascii file containing colormap.
               each row defines a color in one of two ways:
               R  G  B        or
               R  G  B  f     
       where R, G, B specify the red, green and blue values, 
       between 0 and 1 and f specifies the fraction of the range
       reached at this color. THINK values of right of AFNI colorbar.
       The use of fractions (it is optional) would allow you to create
       non-linear color maps where colors cover differing fractions of 
       the data range.
       Sample colormap with positive range only (a la AFNI):
               0  0  1  1.0
               0  1  0  0.8
               1  0  0  0.6
               1  1  0  0.4
               0  1  1  0.2
       Note the order in which the colors and fractions are specified.
       The bottom color of the +ve colormap should be at the bottom of the
       file and have the lowest +ve fraction. The fractions here define a
       a linear map so they are not necessary but they illustrate the format
       of the colormaps.
       Comparable colormap with negative range included:
               0  0  1   1.0
               0  1  0   0.6
               1  0  0   0.2
               1  1  0  -0.2
               0  1  1  -0.6
       The bottom color of the -ve colormap should have the 
       lowest -ve fraction. 
       You can use -1 -1 -1 for a color to indicate a no color
       (like the 'none' color in AFNI). Values mapped to this
       'no color' will be masked as with the -msk option.
       If your 1D color file has more than three or 4 columns,
       you can use the [] convention adopted by AFNI programs
       to select the columns you need.
    -frf: (optional) first row in file is the first color.
       As explained in the -cmapfile option above, the first 
       or bottom (indexed 0 )color of the colormap should be 
       at the bottom of the file. If the opposite is true, use
       the -frf option to signal that.
       This option is only useful with -cmapfile.
    -clp/-perc_clp clp0 clp1: (optional, default no clipping)
       clips values in IntVect. if -clp is used then values in vcol
       < clp0 are clipped to clp0 and > clp1 are clipped to clp1
       if -perc_clp is used them vcol is clipped to the values 
       corresponding to clp0 and clp1 percentile.
       The -clp/-prec_clp options are mutually exclusive with -apr/-anr.
    -apr range: (optional) clips the values in IntVect to [0 range].
       This option allows range of colormap to be set as in AFNI, 
       with Positive colorbar (Pos selected).
       This option is mutually exclusive with -clp/-perc_clp).
       set range = 0 for autoranging.
       If you use -apr and your colormap contains fractions, you
       must use a positive range colormap.
    -anr range: (optional) clips the values in IntVect to [-range range].
       This option allows range of colormap to be set as in AFNI, 
       with Negative colorbar (Pos NOT selected).
       This option is mutually exclusive with -clp/-perc_clp).
       set range = 0 for autoranging.
       If you use -anr and your colormap contains fractions, you
       must use a negative range colormap.
    -interp: (default) use color interpolation between colors in colormap
       If a value is assigned between two colors on the colorbar,
       it receives a color that is an interpolation between those two colors.
       This is the default behaviour in SUMA and AFNI when using the continuous
       colorscale. Mutually exclusive with -nointerp and -direct options.
    -nointerp: (optional) turns off color interpolation within the colormap
       Color assigniment is done a la AFNI when the paned colormaps are used.
       Mutually exclusive with -interp and -direct options.
    -direct: (optional) values (typecast to integers) are mapped directly
       to index of color in color maps. Example: value 4 is assigned
       to the 5th (index 4) color in the color map (same for values
       4.2 and 4.7). This mapping scheme is useful for ROI indexed type
       data. Negative data values are set to 0 and values >= N_col 
       (the number of colors in the colormap) are set to N_col -1
    -msk_zero: (optional) values that are 0 will get masked no matter
       what colormaps or mapping schemes you are using. 
       AFNI masks all zero values by default.
    -msk msk0 msk1: (optinal, default is no masking) 
       Values in vcol (BEFORE clipping is performed) 
       between [msk0 msk1] are masked by the masking color.
    -msk_col R G B: (optional, default is 0.3 0.3 0.3) 
       Sets the color of masked voxels.
    -nomsk_col: do not output nodes that got masked.
       It does not make sense to use this option with
       -msk_col.
    -br BrightFact: (optional, default is 1) 
       Applies a brightness factor to the colors 
       of the colormap and the mask color.
    -h or -help: displays this help message.

   The following options are for debugging and sanity checks.
    -verb: (optional) verbose mode.
    -showmap: (optional) print the colormap to the screen and quit.
       This option is for debugging and sanity checks.
       You can use MakeColorMap in Usage3 to write out a colormap
       in its RGB form.
    -showdb: (optional) print the colors and colormaps of AFNI
       along with any loaded from the file Palfile.
   [-novolreg|-noxform]: Ignore any Rotate, Volreg, Tagalign, 
                or WarpDrive transformations present in 
                the Surface Volume.
  Common Debugging Options:
   [-trace]: Turns on In/Out debug and Memory tracing.
             For speeding up the tracing log, I recommend 
             you redirect stdout to a file when using this option.
             For example, if you were running suma you would use:
             suma -spec lh.spec -sv ... > TraceFile
             This option replaces the old -iodbg and -memdbg.
   [-TRACE]: Turns on extreme tracing.
   [-nomall]: Turn off memory tracing.
   [-yesmall]: Turn on memory tracing (default).
  NOTE: For programs that output results to stdout
    (that is to your shell/screen), the debugging info
    might get mixed up with your results.
