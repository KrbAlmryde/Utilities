Usage 1: 3dcopy [-verb] [-denote] old_prefix new_prefix
  Will copy all datasets using the old_prefix to use the new_prefix;

    3dcopy fred ethel

  will copy   fred+orig.HEAD    to ethel+orig.HEAD
              fred+orig.BRIK    to ethel+orig.BRIK
              fred+tlrc.HEAD    to ethel+tlrc.HEAD
              fred+tlrc.BRIK.gz to ethel+tlrc.BRIK.gz

Usage 2: 3dcopy old_prefix+view new_prefix
  Will copy only the dataset with the given view (orig, acpc, tlrc).

Usage 3: 3dcopy old_dataset new_prefix
  Will copy the non-AFNI formatted dataset (e.g., MINC, ANALYZE, CTF)
  to the AFNI formatted dataset with the given new prefix.


Notes:
* This is to copy entire datasets, possibly with multiple views.
  So sub-brick selection is not allowed.  Please use 3dbucket or
  3dTcat for that purpose.

* The new datasets have new ID codes.  If you are renaming
   multiple datasets (as in Usage 1), then if the old +orig
   dataset is the warp parent of the old +acpc and/or +tlrc
   datasets, then the new +orig dataset will be the warp
   parent of the new +acpc and +tlrc datasets.  If any other
   datasets point to the old datasets as anat or warp parents,
   they will still point to the old datasets, not these new ones.

* The BRIK files are copied if they exist, keeping the compression
   suffix unchanged (if any).

* The old_prefix may have a directory name attached in front,
   as in 'gerard/manley/hopkins'.

* If the new_prefix does not have a directory name attached
   (i.e., does NOT look like 'homer/simpson'), then the new
   datasets will be written in the current directory ('./').

* The new can JUST be a directory now (like the Unix
   utility 'cp'); in this case the output has the same prefix
   as the input.

* The '-verb' option will print progress reports; otherwise, the
   program operates silently (unless an error is detected).

* The '-denote' option will remove any Notes from the file.
