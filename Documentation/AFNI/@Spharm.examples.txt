Usage: @Spharm.examples
A script to demonstrate the usage of spherical harmonics decomposition 
with SUMA

To run it you will need some of SUMA's N27 tlrc surfaces, which can be 
downloaded from: http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/tgz/suma_tlrc.tgz
The surfaces needed are lh.pial.tlrc.ply, lh.smoothwm.tlrc.ply, lh.sphere.asc, and N27_lh_tlrc.spec

To change the parameter settings, make a copy of this script
and modify the section at the top called 'INIT_VARS'
If you do not make a copy of this script, future AFNI updates will
overwrite your changes.
