Usage: Vecwarp [options]
Transforms (warps) a list of 3-vectors into another list of 3-vectors
according to the options.  Error messages, warnings, and informational
messages are written to stderr.  If a fatal error occurs, the program
exits with status 1; otherwise, it exits with status 0.

OPTIONS:
 -apar aaa   = Use the AFNI dataset 'aaa' as the source of the
               transformation; this dataset must be in +acpc
               or +tlrc coordinates, and must contain the
               attributes WARP_TYPE and WARP_DATA which describe
               the forward transformation from +orig coordinates
               to the 'aaa' coordinate system.
             N.B.: The +orig version of this dataset must also be
                   readable, since it is also needed when translating
                   vectors between SureFit and AFNI coordinates.
                   Only the .HEAD files are actually used.

 -matvec mmm = Read an affine transformation matrix-vector from file
               'mmm', which must be in the format
                   u11 u12 u13 v1
                   u21 u22 u23 v2
                   u31 u32 u33 v3
               where each 'uij' and 'vi' is a number.  The forward
               transformation is defined as
                   [ xout ]   [ u11 u12 u13 ] [ xin ]   [ v1 ]
                   [ yout ] = [ u21 u22 u23 ] [ yin ] + [ v2 ]
                   [ zout ]   [ u31 u32 u33 ] [ zin ]   [ v3 ]

 Exactly one of -apar or -matvec must be used to specify the
 transformation.

 -forward    = -forward means to apply the forward transformation;
   *OR*        -backward means to apply the backward transformation
 -backward     * For example, if the transformation is specified by
                  '-apar fred+tlrc', then the forward transformation
                  is from +orig to +tlrc coordinates, and the backward
                  transformation is from +tlrc to +orig coordinates.
               * If the transformation is specified by -matvec, then
                  the matrix-vector read in defines the forward
                  transform as above, and the backward transformation
                  is defined as the inverse.
               * If neither -forward nor -backward is given, then
                  -forward is the default.

 -input iii  = Read input 3-vectors from file 'iii' (from stdin if
               'iii' is '-' or the -input option is missing).  Input
               data may be in one of the following ASCII formats:

               * SureFit .coord files:
                   BeginHeader
                   lines of text ...
                   EndHeader
                   count
                   int x y z
                   int x y z
                   et cetera...
                 In this case, everything up to and including the
                 count is simply passed through to the output.  Each
                 (x,y,z) triple is transformed, and output with the
                 int label that precedes it.  Lines that cannot be
                 scanned as 1 int and 3 floats are treated as comments
                 and are passed to through to the output unchanged.
             N.B.-1: For those using SureFit surfaces created after
                     the SureFit/Caret merger (post. 2005), you need
                     to use the flag -new_surefit. Talk to Donna about
                     this!
             N.B.-2: SureFit coordinates are
                   x = distance Right    of Left-most      dataset corner
                   y = distance Anterior to Posterior-most dataset corner
                   z = distance Superior to Inferior-most  dataset corner
                 For example, if the transformation is specified by
                   -forward -apar fred+tlrc
                 then the input (x,y,z) are relative to fred+orig and the
                 output (x,y,z) are relative to fred+tlrc.  If instead
                   -backward -apar fred+tlrc
                 is used, then the input (x,y,z) are relative to fred+tlrc
                 and the output (x,y,z) are relative to fred+orig.
                 For this to work properly, not only fred+tlrc must be
                 readable by Vecwarp, but fred+orig must be as well.
                 If the transformation is specified by -matvec, then
                 the matrix-vector transformation is applied to the
                 (x,y,z) vectors directly, with no coordinate shifting.

               * AFNI .1D files with 3 columns
                   x y z
                   x y z
                   et cetera...
                 In this case, each (x,y,z) triple is transformed and
                 written to the output.  Lines that cannot be scanned
                 as 3 floats are treated as comments and are passed
                 through to the output unchanged.
               N.B.: AFNI (x,y,z) coordinates are in DICOM order:
                   -x = Right     +x = Left
                   -y = Anterior  +y = Posterior
                   -z = Inferior  +z = Superior

 -output ooo = Write the output to file 'ooo' (to stdout if 'ooo'
               is '-', or if the -output option is missing).  If the
               file already exists, it will not be overwritten unless
               the -force option is also used.

 -force      = If the output file already exists, -force can be
               used to overwrite it.  If you want to use -force,
               it must come before -output on the command line.

EXAMPLES:

  Vecwarp -apar fred+tlrc -input fred.orig.coord > fred.tlrc.coord

This transforms the vectors defined in original coordinates to
Talairach coordinates, using the transformation previously defined
by AFNI markers.

  Vecwarp -apar fred+tlrc -input fred.tlrc.coord -backward > fred.test.coord

This does the reverse transformation; fred.test.coord should differ from
fred.orig.coord only by roundoff error.
