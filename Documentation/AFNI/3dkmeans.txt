USAGE: 3dkmeans [options]
options:
  -v, --version Version information
  -f (or -input)  filename   File loading
                You can specify multiple filenames in sequence
                and they will be catenated internally.
         e.g: -f F1+orig F2+orig F3+orig ...
           or -f F1+orig -f F2+orig -f F3+orig ...
 -mask mset   Means to use the dataset 'mset' as a mask:
                 Only voxels with nonzero values in 'mset'
                 will be printed from 'dataset'.  Note
                 that the mask dataset and the input dataset
                 must have the same number of voxels.
 -mrange a b  Means to further restrict the voxels from
                 'mset' so that only those mask values
                 between 'a' and 'b' (inclusive) will
                 be used.  If this option is not given,
                 all nonzero values from 'mset' are used.
                 Note that if a voxel is zero in 'mset', then
                 it won't be included, even if a < 0 < b.
 -cmask 'opts' Means to execute the options enclosed in single
                  quotes as a 3dcalc-like program, and produce
                  produce a mask from the resulting 3D brick.
       Examples:
        -cmask '-a fred+orig[7] -b zork+orig[3] -expr step(a-b)'
                  produces a mask that is nonzero only where
                  the 7th sub-brick of fred+orig is larger than
                  the 3rd sub-brick of zork+orig.
        -cmask '-a fred+orig -expr 1-bool(k-7)'
                  produces a mask that is nonzero only in the
                  7th slice (k=7); combined with -mask, you
                  could use this to extract just selected voxels
                  from particular slice(s).
       Notes: * You can use both -mask and -cmask in the same
                  run - in this case, only voxels present in
                  both masks will be dumped.
              * Only single sub-brick calculations can be
                  used in the 3dcalc-like calculations -
                  if you input a multi-brick dataset here,
                  without using a sub-brick index, then only
                  its 0th sub-brick will be used.
              * Do not use quotes inside the 'opts' string!

                 volumes. Default is the same as jobname
  -g [0..8]     Specifies distance measure for gene clustering
                Note: Weight is a vector as long as the signatures
                and used when computing distances. However for the
                moment, all weights are set to 1
                0: No gene clustering
                1: Uncentered correlation distance
                    Same as Pearson distance, except
                    the means of v and s are not removed
                    when computing correlation.
                2: Pearson distance
                    = (1-Weighted_Pearson_Correlation(v,s))
                3: Uncentered correlation distance, absolute value
                    Same as abs(Pearson distance), except
                    the means of v and s are not removed
                    when computing correlation.

                6: Kendall's distance
                    = (1-Kendall_Tau(v,s))
                   No weighting is used
                7: Euclidean distance between v and s
                    = 1/sum(weight) * sum(weight[i]*(v[i]-s[i])^2)
                8: City-block distance
                    = 1/sum(weight) * sum(weight[i]*abs(v[i]-s[i]))

                (default for -g is 1)
  -k number     Specifies whether to run k-means clustering
                instead of hierarchical clustering, and the number
                of clusters k to use. 
                Default is kmeans with k = 3 clusters
  -remap  METH  Reassign clusters numbers based on METH:
                   NONE: No remapping (default)
                   COUNT: based on cluster size ascending
                  iCOUNT: COUNT, descending
                   MAG:  based on ascending magnitude of centroid
                  iMAG: MAG, descending
  -labeltable LTFILE: Attach labeltable LTFILE to clustering
                      output. This labeltable will overwrite
                      a table that is taken from CLUST_INIT
                      should you use -clust_init option.
  -clabels LAB1 LAB2 ...: Provide a label for each cluster.
                          Labels cannot start with '-'.
  -clust_init CLUST_INIT: Specify a dataset to initialize 
                          clustering. This option sets -r 0 .
                          If CLUST_INIT has a labeltable and 
                          you do not specify one then CLUST_INIT's
                          table is used for the output
  -c number     Force the program to do hierarchical clsutering
                and specifies the number of clusters for tree
                cutting after hierarchical clustering.
       Options -c and -k are mutually exclusive
  -r number     For k-means clustering, the number of times the
                k-means clustering algorithm is run
                (default: 0 with -clust_init, 1 otherwise)
  -rsigs SIGS   Calculate distances from each voxel's signature
                to the signatures in SIGS. 
                SIGS is a multi-column 1D file with each column
                being a signature.
                The output is a dset the same size as the input
                with as many sub-bricks as there are columns in 
                SIGS.
                With this option, no clustering is done.
  -verb         verbose 
  -voxdbg I J K Output debugging info for voxel I J K
  -seed SEED    Seed for the random number generator.
                Default is 1234567
