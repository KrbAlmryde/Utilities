Usage:
  SampBias -spec SPECFILE -surf SURFNAME -plimit limit -dlimit limit -out FILE

  Mandatory parameters:
     -spec SpecFile: Spec file containing input surfaces.
     -surf SURFNAME: Name of input surface 
     -plimit limit: maximum length of path along surface in mm.
                    default is 50 mm
     -dlimit limit: maximum length of euclidean distance in mm.
                    default is 1000 mm
     -out FILE: output dataset


   [-novolreg|-noxform]: Ignore any Rotate, Volreg, Tagalign, 
                or WarpDrive transformations present in 
                the Surface Volume.
  Common Debugging Options:
   [-trace]: Turns on In/Out debug and Memory tracing.
             For speeding up the tracing log, I recommend 
             you redirect stdout to a file when using this option.
             For example, if you were running suma you would use:
             suma -spec lh.spec -sv ... > TraceFile
             This option replaces the old -iodbg and -memdbg.
   [-TRACE]: Turns on extreme tracing.
   [-nomall]: Turn off memory tracing.
   [-yesmall]: Turn on memory tracing (default).
  NOTE: For programs that output results to stdout
    (that is to your shell/screen), the debugging info
    might get mixed up with your results.
