Usage: imcat [options] fname1 fname2 etc.
Puts a set images into an image matrix (IM) 
 montage of NX by NY images.
 The minimum set of input is N images (N >= 1).
 If need be, the default is to reuse images until the desired
 NX by NY size is achieved. 
 See options -zero_wrap and -image_wrap for more detail.
 
OPTIONS:
 ++ Options for editing, coloring input images:
  -scale_image SCALE_IMG: Multiply each image IM(i,j) in output
                          image matrix IM by the color or intensity
                          of the pixel (i,j) in SCALE_IMG.
  -scale_intensity: Instead of multiplying by the color of 
                          pixel (i,j), use its intensity 
                          (average color)
  -rgb_out: Force output to be in rgb, even if input is bytes.
            This option is turned on automatically in certain cases.
  -res_in RX RY: Set resolution of all input images to RX by RY pixels.
                 Default is to make all input have the same
                 resolution as the first image.
  -crop L R T B: Crop images by L (Left), R (Right), T (Top), B (Bottom)
                 pixels. Cutting is performed after any resolution change, 
                 if any, is to be done.
 ++ Options for output:
  -zero_wrap: If number of images is not enough to fill matrix
              blank images are used.
  -image_wrap: If number of images is not enough to fill matrix
               images on command line are reused (default)
  -prefix ppp = Prefix the output files with string 'ppp'
          Note: If the prefix ends with .1D, then a 1D file containing
                the average of RGB values. You can view the output with
                1dgrayplot.
  -matrix NX NY: Specify number of images in each row and column 
                 of IM at the same time. 
  -nx NX: Number of images in each row (3 for example below)
  -ny NY: Number of images in each column (4 for example below)
      Example: If 12 images appearing on the command line
               are to be assembled into a 3x4 IM matrix they
               would appear in this order:
                 0  1  2
                 3  4  5
                 6  7  8
                 9  10 11
    NOTE: The program will try to guess if neither NX nor NY 
          are specified.
  -matrix_from_scale: Set NX and NY to be the same as the 
                      SCALE_IMG's dimensions. (needs -scale_image)
  -gap G: Put a line G pixels wide between images.
  -gap_col R G B: Set color of line to R G B values.
                  Values range between 0 and 255.

Example 0 (assuming afni is in ~/abin directory):
   Resizing an image:
   imcat -prefix big -res_in 1024 1024 \
         ~/abin/face_zzzsunbrain.jpg 
   imcat -prefix small -res_in 64 64 \
         ~/abin/face_zzzsunbrain.jpg 
   aiv small.ppm big.ppm 

Example 1:
   Stitching together images:
    (Can be used to make very high resolution SUMA images.
     Read about 'Ctrl+r' in SUMA's GUI help.)
   imcat -prefix cat -matrix 14 12 \
         ~/abin/face_*.jpg
   aiv cat.ppm

Example 2 (assuming afni is in ~/abin directory):
   imcat -prefix bigcat -scale_image ~/abin/face_rwcox.jpg \
         -matrix_from_scale -rgb_out -res_in 32 32 ~/abin/face_*.jpg 
   aiv   bigcat.ppm bigcat.ppm 
   Crop/Zoom in to see what was done. In practice, you want to use
   a faster image viewer to examine the result. Zooming on such
   a large image is not fast in aiv.
   Be careful with this toy. Images get real big, real quick.

You can look at the output image file with
  afni -im ppp.ppm  [then open the Sagittal image window]
