Usage: float_scan [options] input_filename
Scans the input file of IEEE floating point numbers for
illegal values: infinities and not-a-number (NaN) values.

Options:
  -fix     = Writes a copy of the input file to stdout (which
               should be redirected using '>'), replacing
               illegal values with 0.  If this option is not
               used, the program just prints out a report.
  -v       = Verbose mode: print out index of each illegal value.
  -skip n  = Skip the first n floating point locations
               (i.e., the first 4*n bytes) in the file

N.B.: This program does NOT work on compressed files, nor does it
      work on byte-swapped files (e.g., files transferred between
      Sun/SGI/HP and Intel platforms), nor does it work on images
      stored in the 'flim' format!

The program 'exit status' is 1 if any illegal values were
found in the input file.  If no errors were found, then
the exit status is 0. You can check the exit status by
using the shell variable $status.  A C-shell example:
   float_scan fff
   if ( $status == 1 ) then
      float_scan -fix fff > Elvis.Aaron.Presley
      rm -f fff
      mv Elvis.Aaron.Presley fff
   endif
