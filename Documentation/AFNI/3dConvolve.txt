Program to calculate the voxelwise convolution of given impulse response   
function (IRF) time series contained in a 3d+time dataset with a specified 
input stimulus function time series.  This program will also calculate     
convolutions involving multiple IRF's and multiple stimulus functions.     
Input options include addition of system noise to the estimated output.    
Output consists of an AFNI 3d+time dataset which contains the estimated    
system response.  Alternatively, if all inputs are .1D time series files,  
then the output will be a single .1D time series file.
