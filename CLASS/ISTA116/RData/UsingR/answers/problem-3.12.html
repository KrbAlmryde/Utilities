    We can split the data up using the condition <b>gender==1</b> as
    follows:
    
<pre>
&#62; attach(normtemp)
&#62; male = temperature[gender == 1]
&#62; female = temperature[gender == 2]
&#62; boxplot(list(male=male,female=female))
&#62; detach()
    
</pre>
    From the graphic it appears that the centers of the distributions are different.
