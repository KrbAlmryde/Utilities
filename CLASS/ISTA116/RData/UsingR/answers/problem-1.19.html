    The comparison of strings is done lexicographically. That is,
    comparisons are done character by character until a tie is broken.
    The comparison of characters varies due to the locale. This may be
    decided by ASCII codes-which yields alphabetically
    ordering-but need not be. See <b>?locale</b> for more detail.
