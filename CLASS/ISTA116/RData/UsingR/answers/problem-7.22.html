    The following will do the simulation:
    
<pre>
&#62; zs = c(); ts = c()
&#62; for(i in 1:200) {
+ X = rnorm(10,0,2)
+ zs[i] = qnorm(.95)*2/sqrt(10); ts[i] = qt(.95,8)*sd(X)/sqrt(10)
+ }
&#62; sum(ts &#62; zs)
[1] 126
&#62; sum(ts &#62; zs)/200
[1] 0.63
    
</pre>
    The z one is usually smaller, but not as often as  might have been
    guessed.
