    The key to solving this is to find the value of z so that
    P(\phat  &gt;  z) = 0.05. This is answered using the quantiles of the
    normal distribution, as \phat is approximately normally distributed with mean p=0.113 and
    standard deviation <font face="symbol">Ö</font>{p(1<font face="symbol">-</font
>p)/n}.
    
<pre>
&#62; p = .113; n = 50000; qnorm(.95, mean=p,sd=sqrt(p*(1-p)/n))
[1] 0.1153
    
</pre>
    Multiplying by n produces the cutoffs
    
<pre>
&#62; n*0.1153
[1] 5765
    
</pre>
    Any value of 5,765 or larger would give a p-value less than 0.05.
