    The <b>log()</b> function can be used directly, as in
    
<pre>
&#62; wilcox.test(log(exec.pay), mu = log(22), alt="greater")

        Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  log(exec.pay)
V = 10966, p-value = 0.004144
alternative hypothesis: true mu is greater than 3.091
    
</pre>
    We see a similarly small p-value as in the previous question,
    indicating that the null hypothesis is not supported.

    If you tried to do a histogram to check for symmetry, you may have
    gotten an error message. This is because of the data values for
    which the compensation is 0. (The logarithm of 0 is treated as
    <font face="symbol">-</font
><font face="symbol">¥</font
>.)  To avoid this error, you can exclude this case first
    as follows:
   
<pre>
&#62; ep = exec.pay[exec.pay &#62; 0]
&#62; hist(log(ep))                 # fairly symmetric
   
</pre>
